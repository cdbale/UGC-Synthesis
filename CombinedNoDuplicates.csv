Recently had a small accident and need transmission work done. In March of 2015, I moved from one state to another and purchased a new vehicle to do so. I called into USAA, got a quote with FULL coverage, when I moved, I changed my state of residency online and inadvertently changed my policy coverage by adding another coverage which in turn deselected automatically my collision. Yes, it is my fault but, I had a history of getting the quote with collision, had it in my previous state.  When I needed it I found it was not there. I ran my ""plea"" and concern all the way up to the CEO's office. DENIED. They told me... cited all the ""legal talk"". It's even USAA OWN policy that I am required to carry collision on a vehicle with a lien/loan and they failed to follow their own policy. They even sent an inspector/adjuster to look at the vehicle before they denied. BOTTOM LINE, USAA really does NOT care about the individual or providing ""customer service"" as the CEO states on his personal page on the USAA site. I will take all of my banking and insurance to another company. I suggest other do the same. SHAME SHAME SHAME on you USAA for not doing the right thing!!!",1

Until recently, their rates and customer service were unbeatable. But two recent events have turned my opinion of them completely. My nephew (who is insured with Nationwide) was rear-ended in slow moving traffic (thank goodness!) on the interstate by a USAA-insured driver. His experience dealing with USAA to cover the repairs and arrange a rental while repairs were done was so abysmal that he finally just let Nationwide handle everything and recoup the costs from USAA - which eventually they did, but not without much back and forth by Nationwide. Then a few months later, I was also 'bumped' in the rear by a driver insured through another company. Working with USAA to get my bumper repaired has been a ridiculously time consuming nightmare. She did not want to file a claim, but I know our only two options were to call someone or call the police - and she did not want to call the police. So I said that I would call USAA and have her tell my insurance company what happened, taking responsibility for the charges, should they exceed what she wanted to pay out of pocket.  The USAA agent listened to her 'statement' and then told me that she was unable to make any notations unless I opened a claim. I asked if this would go against me and increased my rates - she said she didn't know. I finally asked for a supervisor who told me that since I had the other driver's name, license #, phone #, address and vehicle tag #, they would be able to recoup the charges and that the incident would not go against my record. So a claim was opened on my USAA account. Here are the key issues in working with USAA: The agent first hearing the statement was very uninformed - not able to answer questions accurately. The USAA agent ultimately assigned to my claim has been very informed, very nice, but getting in contact with her is a convoluted mess. I can only way to reach her by POSTING messages online! I cannot reply to emails from her - they are ""DO NOT REPLY"" messages that point me to the online thread. If I DO reply online, sometimes other uninformed agents pick up the thread and have taken actions not discussed with me or approved by me - like paying the body shop that provided the quote for the repairs from my policy BEFORE discussing with me. When I have tried to call, I have always gotten an agent who 'starts at the beginning' - one agent even started reading out loud from the first posted message on the online claim thread. When I interrupted her to say that I did not have time to listen to her catching up on my claim by reading all of the background to me out loud, she tersely said to ""please allow me to get informed about your claim!"" I told her study on her own time and either call me back or have the agent assigned to call me. The assigned agent called back 2 days later. USAA's new model of answering insured calls is not working. Their agents also seem to be a mixture of those were of the 'old guard' and know their business inside and out - which was the usual profile of customer service reps/agents in the past - plus a group of new people who are not only poorly informed, but who are rude. Unfortunately that may be in part due to customers like me who are stunned by the lack of knowledge and service and who get frustrated by their ineptitude and have little patience for the severe decline in service. I was one of those who would never consider leaving USAA, but never say never... I'm now researching other companies and will be moving all of our policies and other banking services from USAA.",3

Called USAA and first guy tells me the check is hold because they're waiting for the payee's bank to send the funds back to them, and told me, ""If you don't want holds on your checks you should setup direct-deposit"", this after I had already mentioned the company I work for doesn't do direct-deposit. I started using the @store deposit at the UPS stores, because I don't trust sending them in through regular mail and the mobile app is not 100% reliable. The representative I spoke to 1st was rude, only provided short responses as if he could care less about my situation. It's the beginning of the month when rent/mortgage and other critical payments normally take place. Not only should they not place a hold for such an extended period of time, but also if any hold at all (usually 3 to 7 days) then middle of the month perhaps and make a percentage of the check available to us, account holders. Talked to 2 different representatives and got the same runaround. I've been a USAA customer for 23 years, and even though I've had previous holds (for 3 days and only for a portion of the check I've deposited), this is completely unacceptable. I will be closing my checking account with them after this hold is released.",4

"6",41150.51,"A","McLean","VA",1,"banking",38.9058505,-77.2268645,"I applied for a mortgage this spring and was pre-approved, though I knew my circumstances were a bit unusual. I had voluntarily taken a year off of work and so was technically unemployed when I applied, though I had signed a contract to begin employment again in four months' time, and I had more than enough in the bank for a down payment as well as excellent credit scores. I was thrilled to be pre-approved and assumed that sending in all the required paperwork was just a formality, and that there was no fear of not being ultimately approved.  I found my dream house, made an offer, a contract was signed, and everything was humming along smoothly (I thought) until two weeks before closing, when I was informed by USAA that I was not going to be approved because of my ""irregular"" employment history. They seem to have a policy excluding anyone who has been unemployed at all within the past two years. But it seems to me that if they truly do have this policy, they should never have pre-approved me in the first place, since I am obviously in violation of the policy and they knew it from the beginning. My mortgage processor's response, ""Oh, I guess I didn't realize you'd been unemployed for that long,"" even though I had sent a letter over a month before explaining my employment situation, at USAA's request! It is obvious that she just didn't read the letter and didn't really have any idea about my situation, though I had explained it to her multiple times and had sent a written explanation. The consequences were that I was not able to proceed with the purchase of the home I had already signed a contract for. More significantly for the sellers, they had already bought a new home and moved into it on the assumption that the closing would take place with no problems. So they ended up with two homes they were financially responsible for, and having to start all over again putting their home on the market. I have written a letter of complaint to USAA and submitted it exactly five times to date, with absolutely no response to it whatsoever. I am truly baffled at the entire situation; for a company with such a great reputation, the whole thing truly seems inexcusable. I would never recommend USAA to anyone, and in fact I am considering canceling my insurance policies with them.",6

It was not, and they are reporting derogatory information to the credit bureaus. They are a big company and I am one little person. It is hard to fight them. You will feel the same way. Bottom Line: If you have a problem with fraud, they will say you did it and will not help you. Then, they will harass and bully you for something you don't owe. (Remember: They are a giant, we are little powerless people.) Yes, and they will try to ruin your credit for $35 (when your daughter is slated to attend college in the fall), give you the runaround, and transfer you to various departments unwilling and seemingly incapable of helping you. Extremely horrible customer service overall. (Wait... wait... a positive - my kids have little bank accounts with them and ATM cards. They love USAA. But they are kids, and most likely won't have a problem. (Well, my teenage daughter was charged ATM fees. She was upset, but I said to let it go). USAA will not do the same for you. When you have a problem, USAA sucks! I do not want to feel this way, but I have experienced it first hand.) I have never experienced such difficulty and runaround from a company.

When I very first got the loan I asked multiple times if everything was included on the loan including title taxes, etc etc.. So there would be zero out of pocket costs other than my monthly payment. I was told multiple times everything was included and covered. A month went by and I hadn't heard a word so I called and asked the gentleman that answered if everything was ok and he looked into my file and said ""yes, everything is completely ok"" and I should receive my registration in a week or so.  Well almost a week goes by and my dad calls me and tells me the clean and clear title arrived at his house (I took the loan over from him). I thought this odd so I called and they then informed me, ""sir that's because you're completely responsible for the title and taxes"". This is when I told them they were wrong as I was blatantly told multiple times not once but twice, by two different USAA employees that everything was covered. They looked into it and admitted they do/did see where there was taxes for title included in my loan, however this was mentioned to be an error and shouldn't have been done that way. I go to switch the title and it's over 500$...  I told them I am trying to buy a house and I have a family to support and I can't just blow 600$ when I was told this was included. They said I could completely redo to loan to include it in the loan, which means they have to re run my credit, again! I said ""no, I will not have my credit dinged for your error"". I filled out a complaint directly with USAA thinking they would maybe be reasonable. This is not the case. I had a gentleman from the CEO's office call me and summary of those two phone calls was that yes they made an error but they are not willing to do anything and I have to take care of it.  He blatantly admitted multiple times that they did indeed make an error. I reminded him that I was told yet again multiple times that everything was included and I never would have done the loan had someone mentioned this to me, or I would have at least asked it to be added on the initial loan, to which he said ""he understands"". However they made an error and are not willing to do anything about THEIR error. I work hard as I can for my family and I can't just throw money around.

I was informed that they are forming a ""Catastrophe"" team to deal with all the claims and damage and that they would contact me. On Wednesday, I was ok with that answer. But several days later, I realize this is code for, creating middlemen to make things take longer. If it's a ""catastrophe"" (their words, not mine) shouldn't they work harder to assist their clients faster, more efficiently and more effectively? Instead, they are putting people off. Several days later, I haven't received a call. After pressing the rep today just to determine the next step, the rep for USAA reluctantly said I ""might get a call mid next week."" If it takes 1 week just to get a phone call, how long until someone can come out for a look? For repairs to start? Before I am able to use my vehicles? I pay a HIGH premium for comprehensive auto insurance with USAA and found out today that doesn't include better, faster, or kinder service. I heard, ""Well, the repair shops are full,"" and ""If you have other vehicles"" as excusing USAA for not fulfilling their obligation to provide me with the best possible service in a timely fashion. The costs of repairs will be covered (if and when they get around to it), but NOT the inconveniences & costs I incur caused by their internal process delays. Ironically, the 2 vehicles in my family w/ liability insurance are fixed. The 2 with USAA comprehensive insurance are sitting unusable in my driveway. You'd think it'd be the other way around.

Since that time, I've learned the mortgage department has no real link to USAA and they don't really care about helping their clients. They don't offer condo insurance with any waivers. And they've moved to a Bank of America model of managing deposits - meaning they sit on the deposit, collecting the interest while the customers waits for the payment to clear. In the past, it has taken 2-3 days for a check to clear, now they quote 10 days and as others have noted, they mean at least 10 days. I am shocked that a company with the express purpose of supporting current and former military staffers would follow the big-bank model, but given that they are no longer a credit union, I am less surprised.

A day later I got an email from USAA saying my account has been approved and it has been opened. GREAT! Well two days later I check my other bank account and I see an ach/debit of $35.00 going to my USAA bank account.

USAA said they will take care of me if I paid the overdue amount, and reinstated my policy. So I did. I paid what I needed to, and reinstated my policy on 15 SEP 2015, which is when I got back from my deployment. However because the valuable personal property was stolen on 14 SEP 2015; before my reinstated policy, USAA said ""You are not covered"" and they will not do anything to cover the loss.

It's been almost seven years, and I have not been late on either my credit card or car insurance but USAA would not let me renew my USAA policy on my car because of late payments in '06.

"36",42861.07,"ALICE","Pensacola","FL",1,"banking",30.540654131579,-87.2711326052632,"I've been a customer of USAA for 25 years. There are at least 50 of my relatives who are either retired or on active duty. Twenty years ago, my 20-year-old wonderful son was killed in an Air Force training accident--in other words, he was burned alive. My husband flew Air Force jets to the Russian border and back (in the cold war days). My nephew graduated from West Point four years ago and was in Afghanistan two weeks later. My brother-in-law flew three tours of duty in Vietnam. He returned to Vietnam after the war to help the South Vietnamese rebuild their country. Later, he was one of the founders of the Wall South Foundation. And then there are my eight uncles and their extended families. Are these bonafides enough to earn respect from a company that claims its very existence is to support the military? One would think so. Apparently, USAA doesn't believe so. I suffered for years after my son's heinous death, but 15 years ago, I finally found peace and joy in an adopted daughter. The child of a crack addict, she managed to be admitted to the one A high school in this county and to receive full scholarships for college, including boarding. Now that my daughter has moved into university housing, she still needs my help from time to time. USAA allows its customers to skip loan payments once a year if their payment record is good (mine is excellent), So, in late February, in order to help my daughter, I applied to skip a payment in March. The agent was very courteous. She did some checking and told me that my next payment would be April 15. Case closed? I thought so until March 15 when the payment went through causing me $105 in overdraft fees. When I began making the 20 or so telephone calls, an agent told me that I did not qualify for the ""skip"" because the request came two months early. When I asked, over and over again, what could be done, I was told in these exact words: ""There is absolutely nothing we can do."" And here's something that you may find hard to believe. According to this agent, the agent who agreed to my request had made a mistake, but she was inexperienced and ""we've helped her so she won't make the same mistake again."" But who is responsible for the error? Apparently, I am, but I refuse to be. As far as I'm concerned, the only important words in this whole thing are those of the first agent: ""Your next loan payment will be due April 15."" If the agent was that inexperienced, why weren't you monitoring her? I was finally ""escalated"" to the ""executive solutions team"" whose agent, was, if anything, the worst I'd dealt with. ""Just the facts, ma'am. I'll find the solution."" He didn't. By this point, I was almost suicidal. My credit tanked after my son's death when I couldn't work, but I had slowly built it back. Now it seemed that USAA was about to destroy it. I had already sent the money to my daughter, and there was no way I could come up with the loan payment until May. Now the dunning phone calls began. Finally, after a week of this, I finally reached an intelligent, compassionate agent who said he was taking very careful notes and asked if he could do some research and get back to me. Two days later, I received a letter from USAA that began like this: ""Thank you for banking with USAA Federal Savings Bank. As you requested, due date for your loan has been extended to May 15..."" Gee, thanks. No apology, of course. What may have made the difference is that in my last conversation with USAA, I said I would not stand by and let USAA harm my credit. I mentioned filing a complaint with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Better Business Bureau, as well as every relevant blog I can find. I also mentioned that I would turn my problem over to an attorney. The resolution of this issue could not be more ironic. For weeks, the USAA bank refused to budge. Getting USAA to do the right thing was like pulling an elephant uphill. Someone did finally step up and do something, even though the issue had nothing to do with the ""helping party"". It was the Bank of America, with whom I have a checking account. When I called the bank about my overdraft charges, the Bank of America rescinded $105 in those charges. Based on my experience and on those posting on this site, I'm wondering now if the whole ""we support the military"" isn't just a scam? Military families, because they are so often fractured in some way, need flexibility more than anything, and USAA certainly isn't providing that.",36

I have been a member of USAA for over a decade and am discontinuing all banking services. My account was able to be taken over within a month of them walking me through and setting up all of this additional security for my account. My account was used as a pass thru account since I never use it and it only had $50 in it for the past several years. A USAA employee had to have done this. There is no other way that anyone would know that I never check or use this account. The ""fraudsters"" siphoned money from another USAA customer's account, put it in mine and then a Wells Fargo employee withdrew the funds from my account with a debit card they had expedited to Miami in my name from my account.  USAA allowed this to happen because the ""fraudster"" was able to authenticate himself or herself because they were able to provide my AMEX credit card information. USAA uses any card associated with your account/profile for verification EVEN though anyone can steal your credit card information without actually having your credit card in hand. Once they used my credit card to authenticate, USAA expedited a debit card to them in my name to Miami, FL. The ""fraudsters"" took $20K from the other USAA member's account, put it in mine and then a Wells Fargo employee withdrew it all in $5K increments. They would make a $5K deposit and then someone would withdraw $603 repeatedly until it equaled the total amount deposited.  USAA said that it could be that the fraudsters called in and had the ATM withdrawal limit increased which is authorized when traveling. I said then why aren't there any ATM fees??? If that is the case. There was not one ATM fee which leads me to believe that it was a Wells Fargo employee involved. So now my account has a zero balance and I received yet ANOTHER alert that there was fraud activity on this account which I have closed. USAA has gone down the tubes from back in the day. Stealing from service members is lower than low. They need to look internally at themselves and hire people with integrity.

However, after they realized I was injured, the agent called back and tried to reverse this, saying they weren't going to pay that amount anymore. That it had been a week and the offer expired. At this time, my father, a Vietnam vet, was there and we were talking to the agent, a man named Jason on speaker phone.

They ended up paying me for the car but exploiting my status to their favor, dragging along my injury claim 3 years and I believe, only with the purpose of building a case against me. One month before the statute to sue expired, I received a 1.5k offer, hardly my copay. They have appointed the driver a lawyer to make my life a living hell.

Two years ago, the government agency I was was working for had three breaches of security in a short time frame. My social security number, date of birth, address, and military affiliation were accessed, as well as anyone listed in my background check. The Department of Defense notified me of this breach in June, but it occurred in February. I called USAA after checking my checking account, and credit card for any activity I did not initiate. The first phone call was just for information purposes, there was a negative balance in my checking account and my credit card was almost maxed, which was not accurate. The young man I spoke to informed me USAA was aware of the breach and had placed a hold on my account so no transfers occurred between USAA and my local credit union from the end of February to July when I called. I asked why I was not notified then and was told he really did not know why I had not been notified. The young man was helpful as he could be, made notes and started an inquiry into my credit card balance. He then transferred me to banking so I could talk to someone about my negative account. I was transferred multiple times, to multiple people because no one could help me. What I have found out over many phone calls in the last two years is, they did put a hold on my account without telling me, this stopped funds transfers from my local bank to USAA which in turn caused any payment drafts I had scheduled to be rejected resulting in NSF fees. Well then I find out that the account I was making payments to had not received payment since Feb/March time from but continued to get payment by drafting the frozen account. So now I have fees from USAA and the other company, not to mention my computer I believed to be paid for, had not been paid at all. No one contacted me from either company, I have had to contact them. Upon further investigation I discovered USAA had affected multiple accounts with account gold, putting my very nice credit score in the dumps. I have spent two years trying to get this mess fixed with them without resolution. They expect me to pay for all of it, and will not remove the charges they erroneously added to my account. Now they call me all the time, and mail me threatening letters. I receive as many as 5 calls a day, and a couple of letters a month. Throughout this two year ordeal, I have spoken to a couple of honest people that tried to help, but the majority of my interactions were with rude, accusatory people that had no interest in the truth, they just wanted to know when I would pay up!

It took us four months of scrutiny to get ANYWHERE with them. It was hard to get hold of them which is bad enough but not nearly as bad as what they put us through.  From the beginning they gave us a list of contingencies to meet before they would give us the loan, one of those was for me to pay off anything I had in collections. I did just that and they proceeded with the loan. We got the clear to close message and were a day away from our closing when they abruptly denied our loan. The reason they gave.. because my credit score did not meet requirements after one last check. I called and verified that nothing new had shown up on my credit report, but discovered that when I paid my debts in collection (like they told me to do) it temporarily lowered my score because the debts had been reopened. Trying to explain this to USA was as useless as nailing jelly to a tree.  Here we were with 2 kids and an apartment stacked to the ceiling with moving boxes and we were about to lose our house!

First, they are a debt collector and state that firstly as you are being connected. I was reaching out to find what had happen to our Loss Department claim, that I had flied with them on 12 August of this year. We had hail damage from a hail storm in July. Nationstar did not have any claim on file. Nationstar started to question why I had sent the check and documentation to the other service company instead of Nationstar, I explained they had not been the USAA Mortgage service company at the time of claim.  Nationstar then explained they would have to restart the claim. Although Nationstar had found where my check had been deposited. They proceeded to state that they needed extra documentation completed other than what I had done previously. I asked why I had to start over when the claim had been filed 12 August and now it was the 30th of September. Because Nationstar lacked documentation. As I pointed out USAA had received the documentation because they had deposited the check; the check was in the packet of documentation I had sent to USAA. So seeing it was not fault of mine that they lost the documentation at the turnover of servers. I do not see why Nationstar could not release 40% of funds so I could pay my roof contractor. But I was informed the funds would be held by Nationstar until I resubmitted the required documentation. I spent 30 minutes speaking with this group of debt collectors.  I feel completely abandon by USAA. Called USAA banking/Mortgage to file a complaint and was told by the gentleman I was speaking with that he had spoken with Nationstar over 200 times and the experience was great and all mortgage companies identify as debt collectors. I explained I have had four mortgages in my life and not once until today did they ever identify as a debt collector. So with all this said, I now must start all over with my claim and resubmit all documentation plus the two new documents Nationstar requires. I have a new roof but cannot pay the roofer as of today.

By contrast, years ago when my car's tire suffered a blowout and the car was totaled with 5 persons aboard, and only by luck was nobody injured, USAA's service was magnificent.

He expressed sexism and classism through his words and actions. Additionally, his behavior was discriminatory. He was flagrantly derogatory in his comments. He disregarded what I said and was confrontational. There was no cause on my part for this irrational behavior. This agent appeared to be a man who was on the verge of some type of breakdown. In fact, I believe that this individual, at the very least, be psychologically evaluated and his soundness of mind be confirmed before I would trust him to perform his duties in a professional manner.

I had sought out help from credit counseling agencies and worked with those companies to get bills paid. However, most of the credit card companies said they didn't have to work with me or those credit counseling agencies, and with that, it left me no choice. I consulted several attorney and credit counselors and was told the same: If the company refuses, you are better off. I spent months pondering and researching and came to the same conclusion. I filed bankruptcy and yes, had a credit card with USAA and they were on the list. I do not have regular access to my checking account and must go through the mobile. I had bill pay and that was taken away. Instead of the bill being paid electronically, they send a check taking seven to 10 days for processing. This has caused me to be behind on the mortgage payment. Nobody at USAA communicated this fact to me. Issues occurred in May and in July with electronic payment - my fault on the first, and an electronic glitch on the second one. Both was told, payments cannot be cancelled although the second one cost me over $500 to the mortgage company of money that was supposedly sent and it wasn't. It had been transferred to another account for bill pay. They refused to reinstate electronic bill pay. When I call in on banking matters, the customer service people treat me like I am a criminal or a lowlife who did something horribly wrong, and I do this all the time. I am human; I made some bad financial decisions on my part and tried to clean it up. When no one wants to cooperate with you, you just don't have a choice but to take drastic action. I have been a customer of USAA banking for 12 years and have their insurance for 12 years as well. I have been a good and loyal customer. After getting treated like a criminal, I have no other choice but consider changing banks, such as a credit union. I just sent a letter to Joe Robles, CEO of USAA, requesting that everything be reinstated. I am waiting to see what will happen, if anything. I did state that USAA banking has had the attitude of Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Suntrust where customers do not matter. Everybody falls on hard time; it isn't right to be treated like a criminal or punished for something that was completely out of my hands.

The lady (a USAA insurance user) that hit me pushed me into the car in front of me (with my foot still on the break), causing my air bags to deploy. The lady came out and said she was sorry and then asked if I was ok. Um, no. I was bleeding from the air bags. As I stood there with the girl I hit, she went back to her call and sat on the phone. Two other people helped me push my car off to the side of the road. The cops came and stated she was at fault and she admitted it, too. There were no skid marks showing her attempt to not hit me. She creamed me at about 45-50 mph. She never made an attempt to see if we were all alright besides after it first happened. She sat in her car the entire time on her cell phone. That was just the tip of the iceberg. The next day I called my insurance company to follow up with the message I had left from the night before. They told me that seeing she was at fault, her insurance company is the one responsible for paying for everything. So, I went and rented a car so I could get my life back on track and tried to contact the lady that hit me to get her claim number and I never got a hold of her. That was until she called back by accident. I was told that they would pay for the rental car and not to worry. Well, one week goes by and I don't hear anything. Then I get a call from Donald ** stating that my car was a total loss. He said that they would offer me $10,200 for my car, so I told him before I agree to any number, he needed to send me the report. He compared my car to cars that were the same model but had totally higher miles or different features. I called him back telling him that I would not settle for any less then $12K. But after forking out over $600 for the rental car, I took the settlement that he raised by a little bit. I still got screwed out of $2,200. And in order to get my new car, I had to finish paying off that 2200. He told me that they would pay me back for the taxes on the new car, but of course not the full amount. I got one check for part of the amount made out to me and the old lien holder. I called him back to see what the check was for and to see where the tax check was and he said that he would send it. I brought up the fact that it was made out to me and the old lien holder; he stated that since there was money left on the lien, then I needed to send the check down to them (the old lien holder) and have them cash it and then send it back. I told him that the lien was paid off and I have the lien with the paid stamp on it in my hands.  He then stated that he didn't know that and that I had to prove that the lien was paid off before I could get the check cut in my name only. I got a little pissed at him and he hung up on me, so I called him back and of course got his voicemail. I told him to stop payment on the 2 checks that were made out to me and the lien holder and that I would fax the proof that the old lien was paid off (which that was not on any of the letters I got). That night, I went home and got the lien and faxed it first thing in the morning. Knowing that it takes them 24 hours to get the fax, I called later the next day. He was not in his office and left someone else’s number to contact if we had any questions. I contacted her and never got a response. So the next day, I called again and there was a different number for a different person to contact. So I contacted her. She did call me back and over-nighted me the check.

"114",42419.54,"ANNE","The Plains","VA",1,"auto",38.889848,-77.75907,"On January 22 and 23, 2016 Fauquier County had a major snowstorm. On Thursday evening (January 28, 2016) my son Kevin was driving the Ford F-350 up Turner Mountain Road to get home with my daughter-in-law Allison. There was still snow on the road coming up to our house. When he made the right turn coming up the road, the passenger side of the truck slid to the side of the road, getting stuck in the snow, but the driver side tires were still on the road. When the truck slid, the back of the truck slid in front of a huge snow pile that was created by the person that plowed our neighbor's driveway. USAA Roadside Service was called as we have tow service and they sent Super Transport LLC to pull the truck back on the road.  The following was damaged when the truck slid: (passenger front headlight was broken, passenger front fender had a few scratches, small dent in hood, driver window cracked but did not shatter from Kevin's head hitting the window and the front windshield cracked but did not shatter by an object hitting the window that was hanging on the inside mirror). The truck was fixable and would only have cost $1000-$2000 to fix. When the tow driver arrived, they were ask to pull into our neighbor's driveway, hook a winch to the front of the truck that would have allowed for the truck to be pulled back completely on the road and then the truck could have backed down the road since the truck was still in perfect drivable condition. The tow drivers refused to do this. Instead they lifted the back of the truck with a winch attached to the tow bed and attempted to drag the truck over the snow pile. The snow pile was higher than the truck.  When they were dragging the truck over the snow pile the truck slid into a deep ravine and went into the woods hitting the trees. The tow truck then dragged the truck through the trees causing major damage. They took the bark off three trees and totaled the truck. I also add, the tow guys showed up in tennis shoes and sweat pants, not attire for towing nor the weather conditions at the time and complained about getting dirty.  Following is the damage from the tow company: hole knocked in front grill, passenger front fender completely destroyed, both passenger windows broken out, passenger mirror broken off and still sitting in a tree along with other pieces of the truck laying on the ground amongst the trees, both passenger doors destroyed and will no longer close properly, entire passenger side of truck scratched up and lots of major dents, back passenger side of truck bed destroyed, entire back bumper was destroyed, huge dent put in truck on driver side at back door, new exhaust tip now wedged underneath the truck, tailgate is messed up, the truck bed is out of alignment and the hood. We were told the truck was towed to a secure location in Manassas, VA Thursday night but after what happened on Friday, we are not certain of this.  On Friday the truck was to be towed to another secure location in Fredericksburg, VA. We are not sure who towed the truck on Friday but I do believe it may have been another tow company, but it never arrived in Fredericksburg. Instead it was towed to an unsecure location in The Plains, VA where it sat until Monday at noon with all the windows broken out and in inclement weather. No one at USAA knew where the truck was until Kevin's friend called us on Sunday afternoon and wanted to know why his truck was sitting in The Plains. It was finally towed to Fredericksburg, VA on Monday afternoon. While you can expect minor damage done when a vehicle is being towed, you in no way expect your vehicle to be totaled by the tow company. The tow driver is telling us they are not responsible for any damage they did to the vehicle.  When I spoke with the tow driver he let me know when they arrived that Kevin was the only one with the truck. While that is true, there were five people that saw the truck and the initial damage before the tow truck arrived. Allison was in the truck with Kevin and once we knew the tow truck was close she walked up the road to our house. Kevin also had three friends that were in the area and once they learned what had happened they drove out and stayed with Kevin for a short time. Now USAA through CCC is low balling the value of the truck. The truck was valued as an XL and it is an XLT. And now USAA is telling us the truck would have been totaled from the initial sliding off the road and was not totaled by the Super Transport LLC. I have to keep calling USAA, they do not call you back when they say they will. I have ask to speak with a supervisor, was transferred to his voicemail. Have heard nothing back from him.  We had the 20% of the value of the vehicle coverage so anything happened we would be covered. Interesting how USAA's value of the truck with the 20% comes out the exact value of what the truck should be. Also when we financed the truck through USAA in June 2015, the truck was valued at $12,500. We are now being told the financing department values a vehicle differently than the total loss department. The total loss department has valued the truck at $8200. There is no way the value can drop like that in 7 months. Needless to say we will be leaving USAA. My husband and his two brothers were in the service. My son is now deployed. This is not acceptable treatment to any of our veterans.",114

Polk, LA when my husband at the time called me and told me his truck was stolen. I asked him if he called the insurance company and he said he did. The insurance company never called me about anything, but they say that I was the one that made the claim. They then proceeded to investigate my (now ex) husband for insurance fraud when the truck was recovered. The individual that stole the vehicle was arrested on a separate incident and told the investigators that my ex-husband told him to steal this vehicle. The vehicle was missing for a total of 35 days; however, after the 30th day, the insurance company called me to tell me it was ok to cancel the insurance on the truck (he was the primary driver, I was secondary). So I did. Five days later the truck was located by the Bowling Green, KY police department. I immediately called USAA to tell them of the change.  My ex-husband hired a lawyer from Runyon & Runyon in Clarksville, TN and I do not know what the service provided was. This was his truck titled in his name only, his insurance claim and his vehicle loan in his name only. There were no exchanges between the insurance company and myself about anything other than a change of address for current renters insurance and a letter sent from USAA threatening to drop coverage or further refuse coverage. We changed insurance companies at this time. My ex-husband and I got divorced and I took his name off of all the accounts I hold with USAA, including any insurance accounts.  They did not tell me or notify me of any incidents or investigations they were currently undergoing. Nor did they make any payments out on the previous claim of a stolen vehicle. Whether or not my ex husband did or did not commit insurance fraud, I can not prove. I do not know the name of the individual that stole it nor did I hear his words when asked about the investigation. Yesterday, 21 Jun 2010, I attempted to log on to USAA to check my bank accounts only to find a notice saying I was restricted from online access to my accounts because of the previously listed incident and that further insurance coverage would be denied and my current renter’s insurance would not be renewed. I asked a representative why, because I had not received any notice of this via phone, email, regular mail or any other form of communication. The customer service rep was unable to answer my questions at the time and just made a note in my record of the incident.  I called back to USAA today, June 22, and talked to another customer service representative that told me that I was the one on record for making the insurance claim. I did not make this insurance claim, my ex-husband was the one that made the claim. I was not even in the state of TN to verify that the truck had indeed been stolen. I was in Ft. Polk, LA. I am currently awaiting clarification from a claims representative. The consequences are denied future insurance coverage of any type from USAA, loss of online access to my bank accounts on USAA.com, inaccurate claim against myself for making the claim on August 4, 2008 on my insurance records through USAA.com, emotional stress, and hours lost from work.",125

Back on Friday, last week, I was at work on state property, and my car was parked in a parking lot there. A USAA member hit my driver's door and destroyed my driver's side mirror. He's covered on his wife's policy. They tracked down my license plates to find me, to let me know what had happened. We met up to assess the damage to my car. Their car was apparently fine. They accepted full responsibility and gave me their insurance info, a copy of their proof of insurance. Their car was brand new, and they had just switched from Geico to USAA this month. I really need to tell them they should go back to Geico. I've been with Geico for many years and never had a problem.... Anyway, I call Geico to let them know what's going on, then I call USAA. I've called them many times but have yet to speak with the same person twice. I have an assigned claims adjuster I've never been able to reach. I left him a message on Saturday and have yet to hear from him. I tell the rep I'm speaking with I'd like to talk to Sean **, and they just make non-committal excuses that he must not be available. According to Texas law, a car requires one working, intact mirror that can see at least 200ft behind the vehicle. The law itself makes no sense, as no one mirror can do the job of the three that are standard on most cars. They are standard for a reason. Having driven for twenty years in only vehicles that have all three mirrors, I'm not used to one being gone. So, when I drove to the repair shop for the estimate, drove home afterwards, and dropped my dog off at the vet the next morning. I kept looking where the mirror should be, since the casing is still there, too. Of course all I see is plastic casing and have to look around at the enlarged blind spot to my left. Legal to drive, or no, the car is clearly not safe for ME to drive. This situation lengthens my notice and reaction time. It makes me beyond nervous. Everyone I spoke to agreed it was not safe, definitely not ideal. Parts of the broken casing could come loose and cause an accident I would be at fault for. It could cause injuries. I could accidentally look at where the mirror should be instead of where I need to actually see...and end up hitting someone. Even the first two USAA reps I spoke with agreed it was not safe, and they approved for me to get a rental (on their dime) from now all the way through the repairs, not just starting once the repairs began. They just warned me not to drive the rental a month or something before scheduling repairs. I scheduled repairs that day, but the agreed-upon shop that already did the estimate couldn't take my car until Nov. 3rd.  I picked up the rental Saturday morning; my sis drove me and covered the deposit I hadn't expected and didn't have money for. I left a message with Sean ** to call me because I'd be stuck with the rental on their dime for about two weeks. I had selected the cheapest rental option, not to save me money but to save USAA money. Monday I call them because he hadn't responded. The new lady I spoke with called around to other repair shops to get my car in sooner, but when she came back to the phone the first thing she did was say she'd looked up the Texas law regarding car mirrors, then she restated the state law regarding mirrors and said my car was safe. I said regardless of the law, it's not safe for ME. She said no one I spoke with before had documented that I was allowed to get the rental early, even though the rental pass had already been sent to Enterprise.  No one had documented my statement that my car wasn't safe to drive. She was able to eventually (after two or three tries) find a nearby shop that could take the car sooner. I asked her about getting the car towed to the shop, and she said each repair claim got one free tow. Repeatedly, she said I'd have to pay for the rental out of pocket as long as I kept it before repairs had started...because SHE deemed it drive-able. I said it was not safe. She said that wasn't mentioned in the report from the repair shop, and I said because they never even got into the car; they never tried to drive it. Then she tried to get sneaky. She asked whether I really needed the car towed to the shop. Of course I do! It's not safe for me to drive! After about half and hour or more of this, plus being put on hold several times, she finally suggested that she could hand this over to a manager for review. That only took me asking how to fix this situation like ten times. Until then she said nothing could be done. Tuesday now, I still have this rental I can't afford... so I can safely get to work (I have two jobs). No word from the manager yet. I called again and got a new rep (of course). Sean ** is AWOL, as far as I'm concerned. This new guy acts sympathetic again, like the first two did, but all he can do is confirm it's been sent up to management, and that I should get a call sometime today. He can't discuss it further, since it's been escalated. He says he hopes it gets resolved...but to who's satisfaction? That he did not say. I am SO angry and disappointed in USAA.

The result came from my own adjuster that the whole roof needed to be replaced. So I called USAA and requested that I would like USAA to send ANOTHER adjuster go to look at the roof together with my adjuster. They sent in the same adjuster, the reason was he was the only adjuster in the area (what a joke!). But this time, their adjuster came to my house with his manager, and three of them (my adjuster, USAA's adjuster, and his boss) looked at the roof, and 3 of them agreed that the roof was badly damaged and needed to be replaced.

I called the woman who wrote me the check and she said it cleared her bank on the 4th. So once again I call USAA to ask why my check hasn't cleared and they tell me it is policy.

On Oct. 5, 2011, I was done packing up my house on base at Fort Knox Ky, and had a buddy over to help me load my 2001 Mustang GT that I have spent the last 2 years building. With over 50grand invested in this car, I wanted to be as careful as possible, hence the friend's assistance. As he and I were loading up my car onto the trailer I had rented from U-Haul, the front bumper got caught on the lip of the trailer. We tried to load this car 3 different ways. Out of options, we tried one last way, and it didn't work either. The front bumper was ripped off of the vehicle and was under the car. It ended up damaging the bumper, fender linings, fog lights, left headlight, the headlight/ radiator support mount, and my VIS Racing after market 3.5in Cowl Induction hood.  Now, this hood is a $1000.00 hood before freight shipping. When I put the hood on the car, I knew that if anything ever happened to it, USAA wouldn't pay for it unless it were specified in the policy. So I told them about the hood and every aftermarket part on the vehicle, which is pretty much the entire power and drive terrain. This particular vehicle was listed and insured as a recreational vehicle and not driven everyday. We loaded up the vehicle after pulling the bumper out from under it, and just went on with my trip. I stopped in Tennessee at my father's house, and unloaded the car there. I then notified USAA of the damage and told them what happened. They said no problem, not a big deal. I went ahead and moved my stuff to Texas back to my home of record, and a week later I came back up to Tn.  USAA told me that they only had one shop in the area, but I could take it anywhere. But they still wanted to send out a rep from an appraisal company to over look the car. About 3 days later the rep shows up, looks at the car which was on jack stands at the time because I had to reinstall the drive shaft. He spent about 5 minutes in total over looking the car, snapped some photos and was off. I paid to have the car towed to 7 different shops in Jackson Tn, and everyone of them were scared to mess with the hand woven carbon fiber hood. They preferred to replace it. I had no issues with this, but every shop really didn't want the liability of the job. So after about 2 weeks of looking, I found someone who was willing to do the work in his home shop. He is a certified body man, and comes very highly recommended.  He said no problem, and he would do it at half the cost of labor. USAA said it was a 4-day job, but as my body guy started the repairs, we both started getting the runaround for the hood. In the initial assessment written by their rep, it said on the very first page that the hood was after market and would need to be replaced. USAA did not pay me for the hood upfront. They said to try and have it repaired, mind you, they knew what every repair shop recommended, even theirs said the same thing about the hood. I have been in a rental car that USAA set me up with this entire time.  It is Dec. 10, 2011, my hood was finally paid for the next day, and it's going to take another 7-10 days freight delivery after I order it. Only they don't make that hood anymore, so now I have to figure something else out now. They informed me that I need to return my rental and that I owe on the car since my limit ran out on Nov. 26, 2011. A manager named Audrea from USAA told me to go get my car, and drive it with the damaged hood until the new one comes in. I asked her if she were out of her mind, and at this point I really hoped they were recording the phone call because that was the most insane thing I've ever heard of. I was not going to pick up my car until the new hood was delivered and installed. I got a call from Enterprise this morning and they informed me of my bill at this point.  I am a combat veteran from the Army and have been treated like the biggest pile of hot garbage by this company whose whole purpose is to support the military and their family. None of the formal complaints that I filed have gone anywhere, my car still is not fixed, and I got stuck with a $400.00 plus rental car bill at this point. This is all because they refused to pay for the hood from the beginning. I will not pick up my car until it is completely repaired, because if I do so, that eliminates USAA of any further responsibility. If this is how USAA treats a veteran, service member, or anyone else, I will never recommend them to anyone else. I am also canceling all insurance from them and both bank accounts.

We also noted two areas on the downstairs ceiling, the largest being about 9"" wide by 3' long directly under the dishwasher and the other area of discoloration was around the can light, where the dripping occurred. At no time did USAA mention, or recommend calling Servpro, or other type of water remediation service. Instead, the first of 3 adjusters told us to call one of the 3 contractors they gave us, and asked them to come out and estimate the property damage. We were finally able to arrange for a contractor on 11/3/2010, who told us that we, ourselves could not set up their visit, but that USAA had to have that contractor be placed on ""a property direct repair program for assignment"". After I told this to the USAA adjuster, and that she did not tell us the correct procedure, she finally sent our info to the contractor (**), who came to our home on 11/5/2010 and only took some photos and a few measurements. I don't recall that he even asked us what happened. I have taken extensive notes to date, and photos and recordings. The contractor happened to mention something randomly in our conversation about Servpro, and I said, ""shouldn't they at USAA have told us to do something about the water damage first?"" The gentleman, Ryan **, from the contractor, **, said that yes, normally the water issue is dealt with first, and that the contractor is called secondarily. I said that the USAA rep had incorrectly advised us, and had never mentioned anything about possible mold problems, or continued wet areas due t the broken dishwasher.  From there, the problems began. I have been reading books about mold, and found out that it begins within 24 to 48 hours of wetness. USAA is now trying to say that our sudden malfunction of the appliance, which caused several areas of damage to the cabinetry around the dishwasher, the kitchen floor and the ceiling downstairs, is not sudden, but a long term leak. There is mold, of course, since so much time has passed with USAA never advising us initially about mold issues, which are not covered in Virginia, or our policy. I maintain that our policy states that the ensuing property damage from the breakage of the appliance is covered (except for the dishwasher itself), and that the property damage, including the mold that has formed on the downstairs ceiling insulation (area less than 10feet by 10feet), the still wet kitchen sub-floor and surrounding wood cabinets, is caused by the covered peril,listed in our policy. I already noted from conversations, with the second of 3 adjusters, that USAA is backpedaling on what they intend to cover. Meanwhile, we have been without the use of our dishwasher since about 10/21/2010. Servpro has had ""air movers"" and ""dehumidifiers"" for 3 days, yet the flooring still registers wet. As more time goes by, we are concerned about further mold formation, and resulting health issues. I am already immuno-compromised and disabled, and my husband is currently unemployed. There is a 6"" x 6"" hole cut by Servpro in our downstairs ceiling, which the initial Servpro guy said, since he saw mold on the ceiling insulation, he had to call in their certified mold guy, who came in, and took photos upstairs and downstairs, and wetness measurements, and was supposed to give us his estimate of remediation necessary, before anything else could go forward.  He came to our home on Friday, 11/12/2010. We are very concerned that USAA is trying to claim that they aren't going to cover much, due to the damage being from a long term leak, which it is definitely not. We also note that we, for several years, have been using Hunter Air Purifiers in most of our rooms, which may help dry out and help cleanse the air. Our kitchen floor still registers wet, and the sub-floor under the ceramic tile and cabinetry bottoms next to dishwasher area are discolored, and possibly wet. We are afraid for our health, that of my 11 yr old daughter, and for our wallet. What recourse do we have at this point?",163

I told the rep. that he would not be driving my car after he passed his test. He passed his test and USAA called me and asked for his DL #. I didn't have it at the time and said he was never going to drive this car (Range Rover!). I told her NOT to add his name to my policy EVER and that he would eventually get his own car and insurance once he finished military basic training around December 2016. She assured me that he would not be on the Policy.

Their driver and I were traveling westbound on a 4 lane divided highway. He was in the left lane I was in the right lane. Traffic in the left lane stopped abruptly and he was unable to stop in time so he made an un-signaled rapid lane change to the right. My left front fender was even with his right door (pick up truck) and his right bumper and fender impacted my left front fender just forward of the wheel. Well, by the time we impacted, my full size SUV was knocked across two curbs and his right fender drag down the entire left side of my vehicle. I came to rest on the median between the highway and service road and he stopped about two feet behind me partially on the median.. Police were called and reports filed, there was even a witness that came forward and volunteered her contact information. I reported to my insurance company on September 22nd and was advised to deal directly with USAA so as not to lose my Safe Driver discount. I reported it to USAA on September 23rd and was given a claim number. They also told me their insured had not reported it yet and they would call as soon as he did. I waited a week and with no call back before I called again. I got a different person (who had to review the file wasting 15 minutes of my time) who then told me that their insured has still not contacted them. This went on (with me calling at varying intervals) until the end of October when for the fifth time they told me that their insured still had not contacted them. At this time I contacted my attorney and made an appoint to turn the problem over to them. While waiting for the police to arrive, I had learned that the young man driving was in the US military stationed at a base in the northern part of the state. I sent a letter to the Base Commander on Friday October 28th asking for help locating this young man. I received a call on Tuesday, November 1st, at 0815 hours from the base top NCOs adjunct who promised to take care of the problem rapidly. At 1145 hours, I received a call from the young man’s section NCO who provided me some insight on what was going on. The young man had filed a report with USAA on the 23rd and the NCO had a copy of it in his hands. USAA had requested more information which the young man had provided on October 5th (which included pictures of both vehicles) and again the NCO had a copy of the report the young man filed signed by a USAA representative. I immediately called USAA and explained what I found out (this was still another representative who had to review the file while I was on hold for 20 minutes this time) and when she came back on the line, she said that their insured still had not contacted them. I asked to speak to a manager and got the run-around. I demanded to speak with a manager and was told to please hold while I connect you. After 15 minutes on hold, she came back on the line telling me that all of our managers are busy right now and would you like someone’s voicemail? I did and left a message which was returned around 1400 hours that afternoon. I explained what was going on and was put on hold while the manager reviewed the file (this was getting old). When he came back on the line, he again told me that still he had not contacted them.  I explained what I had found out and he tried to deny it claiming that the NCO was lying to protect his man. I told him at this point I had an appointment with my attorney on Friday and would be in touch. He asked me to hold on a minute while he looked at something. He came back ad finally admitted that their insured had filed a report with them and added information as described, but they needed a verbal statement which they had not received. How many of you answer 1-899 numbers on your cell phone? I am going to cut this short and say that there were many more problems and my car is still not repaired as of November 9th although USAA ha assumed liability for it.

I resubmitted the claim and they canceled my home and auto policy, this was so wrong. I called after receiving the notification and a really rude and nasty woman over talked me and would not allow me to speak about the wrongness of it all. What did my auto policy have to do with my homeowners policy?? I have been driving all my life and never had a ticket. I had written Jose Robles, CEO prior but I was totally ignored by him. All I want is to have my roof repaired. Is this what you have to look forward to after you stay with a company 27 years?? Think twice about USAA before buying a policy!!

I bought a house in Phoenix area in March of 2015. House is 11 years old and had a full inspection on roof, major appliances etc. Clean bill of health. Had heavy rain the week we moved in and not leaks, all good. About three weeks ago we came home to a puddle on the tile in one room but it was near a door and we thought maybe wind blew it in the door - was not a large puddle. Cleaned it up. Last Friday we had lots of storms and really heavy rain around 4pm. I was sitting in the room and water began to pour out of a light fixture then came running through the ceiling. Called USAA immediately and they dispatched ATI - what a joke for water mitigation. The guys showed up and cut a hole in the ceiling, about 12"" square -removed some insulation and put blowers in the room. Also, they took pictures on the roof and said there were broken tiles and shifted tiles - showed me the pictures. Hmmm sounds like wind damage right? 60 days ago roof was fine now broken and shifted tiles. It takes ATI three trips and three different people to get the place dried out by making the hold in the ceiling now 3 feet square and removing tons of insulation... really - couldn't figure this out the first time? was the water hiding? Now the fun starts - let's play the estimate your damage game and then deny the claim. ATI shows up to give an estimate of $2100+ to replace dry wall, insulation and paint - really, sounds really high but of course they know I have a $2,000 deductible so nicely matches and they will also be paid for the nearly $1,800 water mitigation - what an amazing estimate.  Then the USAA roofing contractor shows up and never really looks under the tarp but comes up with the conclusion that ""it's bad maintenance of valleys and vents"" so no storm or wind damage and all out of my pocket. Amazingly no one can find the pictures from the original crew that shows broken and shifted tiles. Response from ATI is ""oh every roof has broken tiles - lots of them"". Of course no one can explain how a roof goes from good on inspection and not leaking to poorly maintained and leaking in 60 days. If this was an old house and roof I can get it - maybe. This is not the case. It's a giant racket - USAA will never pay a roof claim, contractors will never bite the hand that feeds them and their quotes always come close to the deductible.

I have a 1967 VW bug that I have owned for a very long time and really love. Everywhere I drive people stop and admire the little car. I love her so much that I pay for USAA full auto comprehensive to make sure my baby is protected. I never want to lose her. Unfortunately a back fire caused the engine to catch on fire and I am working with USAA to make her right again. The first thing that happened is a USAA appraiser came out in an official USAA car and walked up to her and had said the following: ""Wow this looks really bad, I hate to see when this happens, This looks like a total loss."" At this point USAA had no idea of the value of my car or what the damage really is. It just looks really bad. The appraiser came back in a few days letting me know that they have come up with a value for her based on three cars they found on the internet of just over $2,000. I have asked USAA for the links to validate this valuation and I have never received them. Where did they get this number? I had her towed to a VW bug auto shop that specializes in repairs and also sells VW bugs. To get the facts from professionals, something I would think USAA would have done. The shop had three different professionals do an estimate of what was the value of my bug before the fire. The estimated value was between $6,000 and $6,500. The shop has given me a quote for total repair of $4,500. Note also that USAA had estimated just over $2,000 for repairs. I have asked for the name of a shop so that I might be able to use it and have not got an answer. I presented this to USAA and the first thing they have noted that even if USAA used these numbers it is still a classified as a total loss based on the ratio of the cost of repair to the total value of the car. How can they do this to me? She is not a total loss. To use these numbers I am going thru a very involved process to validate them which I am doing. Once I have these numbers validated and USAA does not accept them I will have to go to judge who will make the decision to who is right. This will cost somewhere around $500 which we will split.  If I win, I still lose. USAA will still keep her classified as a total loss. Instead of paying the $4,500 for repairs they will have to pay the $6,000 for the total loss. This means that I have to give them the title to my baby and then buy back the title based on the salvage yard estimate of her value. Then I get a new title that is a salvage yard title.

After calling to cancel our auto insurance, we found out that on the first of the month, we made an automatic withdrawal of 137 dollars.  I figured we would get the money back since you normally pay car insurance for the month after the payment. We were told by multiple agents that we would get our money back no problem, and even were apologetic to us. After a week, I called again just to see where we were at with getting a refund.

I called and explained to mortgage company that in our area flood of 1997 (our 100 year flood) that the water level in my area had crested about 2 inches below the top of the curb.  I went with USAA because I had my Home and Auto with them at the time, initial annual was about $600. It has increased slightly over the years but has now gotten totally out of control. 2013 premium was $1,571; 2014, $2,021. I have contacted several other insurance companies over the years and have been told by all that the premiums are regulated by FEMA. So last year I contacted FEMA and received a response that my mortgage company imposed the required flood insurance and does not set rates. FEMA does, however, require that you acquire a new policy at least 45 days prior to expiration of current policy and formally request a change in writing to FEMA to change insurance companies????? So the plot thickens, on March 24, 2014 our local paper posted ""Nevada set to see higher flood-insurance costs,"" **. I think this is very amusing as from the USAA website they are proclaiming a net worth of $22.9 BILLION DOLLARS as of June 2013, **. So the way I see it is USAA had to pay out a substantial number of claims for victims of Katrina and Sandy, but not without a fight, as I am sure some policy holders will agree. Now they have FEMA backing their extortion operations, so hopefully they will see a net worth of $33 Billion at the end 2014.",235

As part of my USAA auto insurance, I paid extra for years and years for the ""emergency roadside assistance."" The first & only time I ever used it was last year, when my car went into a ditch on a muddy road. I called USAA. They transferred me to ""Agero"", which is the company to which USAA outsources its roadside assistance. This was between 1-2 pm on a Saturday. I was four miles from the nearest town, which has two or three service stations with tow trucks etc. There are many other towns in the area with lots of tow truck providers. BUT - my USAA-provided ""Agero"" roadside assistance didn't show up until after - get this - 9 PM that evening. I had to go sit in a nearby house for hours while waiting, since it was freezing outside. I didn't know the people, but luckily they were fine. And they gave me some food & water, which was necessary with the 8+ hour wait. I am a female and was alone, so this was not a good situation and could have ended very badly. I called USAA to complain a few times during the wait, and they just kept blaming this ""Agero"" company they outsource the work to. When the towing guy showed up, he told me he was based in SE Portland - at least 30 miles away. He told me they were 'busy' when the call came in, and then there was ""traffic"" on the way. Well, duh. He had to go through an entire city and then numerous towns in order to get to me from that far away. All he had to do was hook my car up & pull it out of the ditch. 10 minutes. I absolutely recommend AGAINST using USAA for this type of coverage, as it turned out to be terrible, included an inexcusable wait, and made my situation dangerous. You don't want you or a family member alone in their car in a semi-rural area for hours, and needing to go into the house of strangers while they wait for help. Plus - waiting HOURS for a tow truck from 30 miles away when there are a zillion towing services in the area? They are not set up to assist at all. Completely irresponsible. USAA's response? Nada.

The pain was increasing for both of us. Since I had undergone major spinal surgery my general doctor gave me medicine and sent me back to my spinal surgeon. My son was treated and sent home with medicine ultimately being OK. Over the course of months and different medical procedures to try and alleviate the pain that was not going away, my surgeon decided to move forward with another surgery to try and correct the damage that the car accident had done to my back. We have medical coverage with USAA and were contacted about submitting medical bills and how the procedure worked. They paid out on my son’s bills and a small payment to some of the outpatient procedures that the doctor had ordered for me. But once the big bills started coming in we started having issues. At this point we have now had 17 claims adjustors (literally) and never a straight answer as to what else is needed to pay these bills. We have faxed hundreds of pages of medical records, itemized bills, doctor’s notes and so on. Every time only to be told something is missing and they need more information. We have talked to supervisors who claim they are working on this issue, managers who say they will personally request the information needed and told that they just got the records and it takes time to go through them.  This last time we were told that since my back was pre-existing because of a surgery 4 years prior, they needed one years’ worth of records to prove I was not filing a false claim. I have a 12 inch scar up my back and rods and bolts all through it and I can't bend over like a normal person anymore since the surgery from the car accident. Keep in mind that this claim is now going on three years and no end in sight. I have had the same surgeon for all surgeries and he tried different medical treatments before coming to the conclusion of doing the surgery. After all, just going under the knife and having to rehab from this kind of surgery is no easy task, so to now be told of a possibility of myself filing a false claim is ridiculous. This company has made it clear that they are stalling until a 3 year medical time limit law runs out for me. Which I only recently found out about.  As of my last email they have flip-flopped from needing more documents, to they need time to look it over because it looks questionable. I have requested that they explain the delay, and as to why after almost 3 years they are now all of a sudden backtracking, only to be ignored in countless emails. They do not return calls, answer email questions, or send the documents requested on numerous occasions. They email when they feel like, and blatantly ignore my questions or requests, and just change what the problem is time after time. It is a shame they act so horribly towards their customers when the almighty $$$ is concerned.  I will continue to spread the word on all social media and online resources available to me, as to how they have deceived and lied to a handicapped person for 3 years. They do not take care of their own, as they have you believe from their commercials. Several of my family and friends, 1 of whom had been with them for decades, have already dropped them.

After being transferred many times by their customer service representatives, each one telling me I had been transferred to the wrong department, I became very agitated. After I was informed that USAA would not pay for all of my damages, I asked who was responsible for the rest of the damages, the USAA customer service representatives informed me that I would have to sue the policy holder for any damages left over above what USAA would pay. I did not agree with this. We pay insane rates each month and we think our insurance company will be there for us instead of advising people to sue us.  So I called the policy holder myself and told her what her insurance company advised me to do. ""I am not out for money,"" I told her, ""I just want my car fixed. Since your insurance company refuses to pay the complete cost they want me to sue you."" She did not seem happy to hear that. Now I would like to tell the world that if you have USAA insurance they will not have your back. I paid my own deductible and went through my own insurance, which has their own legal department that will get the money from USAA the hard way. But that is why I pay each month, so I can count on them to be there for me. Not to advise other people to sue me.  So be warned USAA policy holders, your insurance company is only there for themselves and they could care less if you get sued.

The first two hours, he played Mr. Nice Guy and recorded what I said about the evening, which was fine.

The weirdest part of the conversation was at the end, he made a really off colored racial comment to me and I immediately reported him for it. They took him off my case and assigned one of his buddies to it, but amazingly ever since I reported him, I literally have had no cooperation from USAA or special investigations.

The estimate came in at about $500.00. The lady at the shop told my mother that USAA are notorious for not paying claims. My mother called USAA several times only to get the runaround. Then finally on August 10, 2011, she received a letter from USAA. It states that they have denied the claim, saying that the police report does not have enough evidence to support this claim. They said there are conflicting statements.  I spoke last week to the officer who wrote the police report and who spoke to the other party involved. He told me that the guy seems to be honest and was not disputing the fact that he was at fault. The officer also agreed to call the claim adjustor, and tell him that the guy admitted the accident was his fault. I believe USAA is taking advantage of the fact that my mother is old and sick. The claim is not a large claim. And even the officer said he didn't understand why they are not paying the claim. After all, it is under $1000.00.

When I check it I had a large lump sum of money in it. At that moment I was happy, because I thought my VA disability compensation was finalized and I received my back pay. The next morning I got up for work I realized my debit card was missing and didn't know what happen to it. I looked around my house and in my vehicles and didn't find it. So when I got to work, I went online and reported my debit card missing. Once I finished that I took another look at my checking account and that's when I realized that the money that was in my account the day before was missing. It had been withdrawn from two banks in Chicago, Illinois, that I was later told by the representatives from USAA, but in my Saving I notice that there was $5000 in it.  This had me confused and I didn't know what's was going on, but I did know that that money didn't belong in my Saving Account because I didn't put it there. So I started changing all my online password, security question and called USAA to report suspicious things going on with my account. I told them about the money that was in my Checking Account that was there that day and withdrawn by the next day and I also told them about the money that was in my Saving Account. They said they would take a look at it and call me back. They locked my accounts for security reason while they investigated, so I had no access to my account.  I waited a few days for their call and never heard anything back, so I call them. After being on hold for long periods of times and being transferred to 10 different Representatives, someone finally explained to me that it was fraud on my account and that they were send it to the fraud department to be look at and that I should hear from them in a week. I then explain to them that I had money in that account and I need access. They said, that's not going to happen, due to security reason, my account was locked and that I would hear from them in a week. I said ok, so I waited a week no call, so I decide to wait a few more days, still no call, so I decide to go ahead and call them.  After long periods of waits, they finally directed me to the fraud department and start explaining what they believe had happen. They went on by saying that checks which were money order from Hawaii was deposit into my Checking and Saving Account and then withdrawn in Chicago. I asked how was that possible I stay in Texarkana, Texas. They said somehow some way someone got my information, deposited checks in my account through the mobile and withdrew the money. So at this time I'm upset not think straight because my money from the VA is about to go direct deposit into that account and my check from my job. So I asked what's going to happen to my account and they said more than likely it's going to be closed and that I should filed a police report and that someone from the fraud department will be calling me back in a couple of days to explain in detail what's going on.  Once again I'm waiting on them to call me and while I'm waiting I go file a police report. That next day I get a letter in the mail from USAA saying, ""We can no longer do business with you, after we determine that you deposited fraudulent checks in your account"". That the trust between myself and the bank had been broken and that effectively October 23, 2016, USAA auto insurance and Homeowner insurance can no longer do business with me. So from me being a victim of identity theft, USAA turned it all around and blame me, said it was my fault for what happen. I called them to speak to someone about this matter. After being hung up on 3 times and on hold longer than 30 minutes, I was finally able to talk to someone.  With me being angry at this time I asked them why in the hell would I fraud myself. I had been with USAA for 8 years. I have a Checking account, a Saving account, my truck is financed through them, I have auto and homeowner insurance through them and my VA checks and checks from my job are directly deposited into my account, so why would I do that to myself knowing it's a federal crime, plus I works for the federal government. They start explaining maybe I gave my information out to a stranger in return of getting money. I told them do they think I'm that stupid that I would give out my information for something that would ruin me, my credit and my job, and that they wasn't making any sense.  Then they said well it got out somehow and their decision is final. They said that they wasn't going to argue because USAA and their system has never been breached and that it doesn't matter what I say the decision is final. So I ask if they were going to even take the police report, they said yes and gave me a fax number to send it to. I faxed the police report to them and put attention to fraud department and then call back asking about my money that went into that account. The representative told me that my money that was direct deposited into that account is now part of them collecting the fraud. At this moment, I'm upset so I tell them if they going to accuse me of something that I didn't do that they can at least give me copies of all the fraudulent checks so I can give them to police.  The representative said they would and asked how would I like to receive them. I said fax them to me and they agreed, so I give them the fax number and then they put me on hold for about 20 minutes and then gets back on the phone and says it's going to take a couple days before I can receive them. I asking them what's the purpose of me giving you the fax number if you can't fax it to me today. They went on talking about thing like these take time to fax out, basically give me a bunch of bologna, so I hung up and report that conversation to the police because I felt like they were doing something suspicious. A couple of days go by and copies of the fraud checks come in the mail but it was only 3 of them, so called back to see why I didn't receive all them.  The representative said that that was all they could send. I told them that wasn't what I was told when I asked for them. Then they said well that is it and I said fine and I asked did they receive the police report I faxed them. They put me on hold for 30 minutes and then said no, they haven't receive anything and asked where did I send it to. I told them the Fraud Department where they told me to send it. They put me on hold for another 20 minutes and said, ""No we didn't receive anything"", and I told them that it was strange because I have a confirmation page saying that you received it but I can send it again. They said, ""No that's ok, we really don't need a police report and if we do we can get one online"".  So after talking to them, I took the copies of the fraudulent checks and a copy of the confirmation page to the police station and told them that I request copies of all the fraudulent checks but they only sent me 3 and the detective said that's fine, since they won't send it, they will subpoena it and other information. I realize a lot of people out there think USAA is just the greatest bank in world because of their low insurance, well I did too. People please don't get fool by USAA, they are crooks and you may say to yourself that this will never happen to you, because USAA treats you good. Well that is their job until something like this happen. I have never been hung up on, put on hold and disrespect by anybody or company like I have with USAA after this identity theft happen and it never happen before then with them, so that should tell everyone something.

I promptly called USAA Christmas day on the emergency line and they took down all my information and directed me to call a company like SERVPRO. They would need to pull the water out of the house and secure the property since 2 doors had been broken. I immediately called SERVPRO and they recalled a response team from their homes on Christmas day to come to rescue my home. I was called by a USAA adjuster a day later to tape a statement from myself on what had happened. I provided approximately 10 minutes of testimony and the adjuster said ""ok I'm going to turn off the tape now and review your policy."" One minute later he stated that my policy had a clause that since my home had been vacant for more than 30 days they would deny my claim.  I immediately called SERVPRO and spoke to the owner and asked his advice and if he could please give me an estimate what the clean up and damage would cost me. He stated that clean-up would be approximately $15K and rebuild of home would range between $60K to $100K. So I called USAA back to get a better understanding that just maybe they were overlooking something since I pay every month religiously on the due date.

The representative we spoke with after the accident stated that my wife was at fault due to the fact that she still had use of her brakes even though the brake usage had been diminished because of the previous accident that was not completely. The justification was that she may not have had 100% of the use but still had functional use of the vehicle. This did not bother us at the time because USAA did not raise our rates. After switching from USAA to Progressive we were informed that the at fault? accident on 11 Aug 06 would cause us to pay an increased rate.  Upon hearing this accident was affecting our premium on the 16 Feb 09 I contacted USAA with the assistance of Progressive via a three way call. The USAA representative informed that the original rep would have to handle contesting their decision. Later that day, the claim reps manager called me to inform that the fault of the accident was not the brakes because the repair shop inspected them before releasing our vehicle and couldnt find anything wrong. I informed the manager that my wife and I took our SUV to the dealership where the maintenance manager test drove the car with us and stated there most certainly was an issue with the brakes. Toyota replaced the Master Cylinder and the brake issue was resolved.  The USAA manager then stated that the two instances were not related because of the inspection done by the repair shop and the assessment completed by the insurance adjuster. I informed that the failure of their people to identify a problem doesnt automatically make the issue my wifes fault. The USAA manager questioned why we waited so long because the incident was now outside their statute of limitations which was two (2) years. I informed that our rates had never increased for this accident until we switched insurance agencies. At this point the manager challenged the fact that our rates never went upwhich they didnt.  The USAA manager started to repeat her argument that the vehicle had been inpected and the original assessment would stand and that USAA could not and would not reverse a decision made over two years ago. I pointed out how USAA had told us that we were originally at fault because we had some use of the brakes when the accident happened even though it was associated the previous incident, then when we called back we were informed that the accident was unrelated to the previous incident with a convoluted explanation that is only valid if the master ABS cylinder went out within two days of our car was released to us. Upon hearing this the USAA manager said she wasnt going to reverse the decision period. I then informed I would be submitting this complaint and ended our conversation.  USAA mislead regarding the reasoning of a claim which didnt surface until we switched insurance companies and is costing over $500 a year difference in premium. I was only seeking a letter stating the accident was not at fault meaning my wife wouldnt be held accountable with an increased premium due to the automobile not being repaired correctly. But were instead mislead and then accused to cover the fact that they can no longer make the change. Progressive stated they could make the change up to 35 months back and that every company is different. Do yourself a favor, choose another insurance company over USAA.

I tell him I want OEM and he tells me that USAA says to use Chinese made crap. Nope. Not going that way. I call Shaniqua or whatever at local Va. Beach branch location (actually a headquarters location) and she tells me that the limits of my policy blah, blah, blah. I tell her that I don't have a limit as the accident was NOT my fault. I have to argue with her, finally a supervisor looks up the accident and notices that the difference in price is something like $75.00 dollars ($79.00?? cannot remember). Long story short, she approves this... gee, thanks! So it gets much better. I talk to someone in San Antonio and she basically insists that I go see a Dr. I tell her really, no problem. She still insists. Okay. I go. Here's where it gets good. In Virginia, we have this little part of insurance that basically covers your medical up to ""x"" amount. I had a minimum coverage of $2,000.00 dollars, and since Va. is a ""stackable state"" I actually had $4,000.00 coverage (2 vehicles). It's called Med-Pay. So, I hire an attorney for the accident. I go to various Dr.'s (had a ringing in ear after accident that would not go away) and even an MRI. So, my medical bills get submitted, Auto Injury Solutions, which I call affectionately Auto Injury Confusion, did what another on here said; Made frequent and repeated requests for information to which the denied absolutely EVERYTHING. They did not approve 1 invoice regardless of information procured. I did get money after many, many, many phone calls to USAA and basically using the vilest language imaginable. I wrote vile emails, slammed them on social media and even created a web page that specifically pointed out the horrible customer service. I was criminalized by Auto Injury Confusion AND USAA by their continued denials of payment (less than $4,000.00). I have been with USAA over 35 years. The company has changed a lot over the years in their approach to handling claims in certain ways. It all changed when they opened the flood gates and allowed so many others in that were not officers. The utilization of Med Pay is simply a way to pass the buck and deny payments. They have some of the least expensive auto insurance in the country, the homeowners is costly on the other hand.

I have been with USAA on my own for 4 years now about and was with them on my parents' accounts when I was younger. Last week I called to get an auto loan to buy a used car. I asked for 10000 I had my father co-sign for me. I got approved and my interest rate was going to be 4.50%. So I then found a car at a dealer and called the USAA up and let them know and I filled out the rest of my loan online.  Some of the information was wrong because it was stating I was getting a loan for 10000 but I found a car and only needed the loan for 5415.00. So I asked the lady and she said it doesn't change but on my addendum it will show the current amount. So as I'm filling this out, before I sign, I asked again what my final interest rate will be 'cause it was showing different info on the screen and she told me 4.25 if I sign up with auto payment. So I finished the paperwork. I wrote down everything she said to me and all my payments and such. So when I go to my email and print out the addendum it says I have an interest rate of 7.99 -- big difference form 4.25 to 7.99.  I call to confirm and they said the lady I talked to put I was getting a car no older than 2 years old and I told her, ""No older than 2007."" The car I bought was in fact a 2007. They stated that I messed up and I signed it and that there is nothing I can do. They didn't even try to help or get a satisfied customer. All he said was, ""OK, have a nice day."" So now I am going to start looking for a new bank to put my money in and new car insurance, new renters insurance, and pay off this loan or try and refinance it. I will also be telling my family to do the same because my father, the co-signer, is also very mad and my mother will soon switch also.  This bank states they are the number one trusted and secure bank. I call BS (excuse my language) because I do not trust them anymore. They are trying to get more money and not take fault in their mess-up. I will no longer bank or do any association with USAA and I will make sure I let everyone know not to use USAA.

"326",41103.81,"CHRIS","Beaufort","SC",1,"homeowners",32.4162905714286,-80.6737504285714,"Our home experienced a water loss due to plumbing in the upstairs kitchen. Paul Davis Restoration (a preferred network provider of USAA) was hired for the emergency water mitigation. During the water mitigation process, USAA continuously stated that coverage for temporary accommodations would be reviewed and despite our offer to reimburse our tenants for staying in a nearby hotel, they stayed on the premises during the water mitigation which was in the middle of winter. The temperatures in the home reached a sweltering heights of 100 degrees or higher with humidity. Our tenants were informed to keep the central air system turned off during the water mitigation. The water loss was so severe, the water could be seen draining into ducting vents in the floor in the kitchen.  Our tenants informed the Paul Davis Restoration water mitigation crew of this, as we did as well after our tenants informed us. There was one fan blowing in the vicinity of the central air system equipment. We inquired as to whether or not the service panels were removed and the air handler inspected for standing water during this time. It was not. We were told their equipment would pull the water out of the air from the air handler. Our tenants also noticed that Paul Davis Restoration didn't remove the vinyl flooring from underneath the cabinetry. All they did was remove the kick panels from underneath the cabinetry and place fans in that direction. After Paul Davis Restoration removed all of their water mitigation equipment, we inquired as to when restoration would begin. Paul Davis Restoration was also hired to do the restoration of our home. We waited for restoration work to commence, but nothing happened. After about a month of waiting, of which during this time our tenants continuously informed us of the continued state of the property (that they were walking around on nothing but subflooring) and USAA continuously informing us the coverage for temporary accommodations was being reviewed, we started following-up on what our restoration contractor from Paul Davis Restoration (Peter **) was saying. He informed us he was waiting for the company who was going to fix the cabinets and was going to come in and do the work to detach them.  However, we were informed by our USAA claims representative, Felicia ** that Paul Davis Restoration was supposed to detach the cabinetry. We found out that nothing had been done or ordered in the entire month after Paul Davis Restoration had pulled their water mitigation equipment from the home. We then caught Paul Davis Restoration lying to us about why the progress had been delayed. I had called up the companies they stated they were waiting on and found out the orders for their services had only been requested that day. So we fired Paul Davis Restoration and brought in another contractor, who immediately informed us that they hadn't cut enough of the damaged drywall out (which was also verified by a 3rd party mold remediation company that same week). Needless to say, once we got the kitchen cabinetry removed and the vinyl pulled up, we found mold. USAA denied accountability, even though their preferred network provider was supposed to be held to a 3-year guarantee on workmanship. Paul Davis Restoration also denied liability (at first). We also found mold in the venting and the air handler at a later time also failed due to an electrical short from standing water from the loss, as determined by a COL inspection. USAA wanted us to have the entire air handler unit and heat pump detached and shipped to their inspectors in Georgia to determine the cause. We contacted a couple of other insurance agencies, such as State Farm to see how they manage such situations, which led our formal request for USAA to pay for the COL inspector in the area that State Farm utilizes. They agreed, but never paid him. They stated he never furnished him with the appropriate paperwork.  Due to the COL inspection stating the loss and compromise of the central air system was due to the water loss, we requested USAA cover the costs of repairing or replacing it. We had a previous estimate done by an HVAC company in the area, who estimated around $3,500 in repairs. USAA wouldn't agree to them, despite the COL inspection results, and only 50% of the cost at that. The units weren't even 10 years old, but the warranties weren't transferable. USAA only covered $260 of the repairs to the HVAC, of which in the end cost us $5,600 for a new air handler and heat pump due to catastrophic electrical failure caused by the shortage induced by the water that had entered the unit.  Paul Davis Restoration also claims they aren't accountable for its loss or the increased mold spores in the ventilation resulting from the standing water and allowance for excess moisture build-up in the system. We hired a mold remediation specialist to take lab samples, which required their services. We weren't surprised to see the increase in the estimate from the new contractor than was received by Paul Davis Restoration. Paul Davis Restoration’s was only about $12,000 where as the new contractor's estimate was roughly $30,000. USAA then informed us a USAA adjuster would need to come out to determine the cost of the repairs. We requested a 3rd party insurance adjuster, so one was hired from IAS, whose estimate was very close to that of the $30,000 estimate. It makes you wonder what sort of relationship there is between USAA and Paul Davis Restoration. It doesn't stop there though.  National Restoration was hired by USAA to repair the cabinetry. They came in and simply refurbished what was there without detaching it; trying their best to make it look as though it was fixed on the surface by applying veneer over the damaged pieces. However, when our new contractor went to install the new flooring, they found that the structural supports and foundation of the cabinetry had not been repaired at all and the water damage was quite visible. It took us several months arguing with USAA to get them to have it done properly, in which case we chose to replace the cabinets ourselves with stock cabinetry from Lowe’s. The cabinets in the condition they were in made the home uninhabitable by state standards. However, despite our various attempts at requesting USAA to allow us to get another contractor to replace the cabinets was futile.  It went on for almost five months before they said they would cover the cost of the replacements; however, not after they brought in the same company who messed it up the first time to make a new estimate to cover the cost of the replacement or repair which was lower than their original cost of replacement. The thing about these types of cabinets is that they are glued together, which makes repairing them impossible. Coincidentally, the difference in cost in replacing them was right around how much National Restoration originally charged USAA to the shoddy repairs in the first place. The cabinets were old and the lowers couldn't be repaired or replaced, without replacing the upper cabinets as well.  Despite the matching clause in our insurance coverage, which would require USAA to pay for the repair or replacement of the uppers as well to match the lowers, they denied us that coverage, which is why we did it ourselves. We traded our own labor for the replacement of the upper cabinets to match the lowers. Fair? Legal? I don't think so. When we finally got the go ahead to have the damaged cabinets removed, we gave Paul Davis Restoration right to cure. In which case, they came out the next day to remedy. However, they didn't put up any sort of barrier to prevent the spread of mold spores throughout the house (of which incidentally, our current tenants were allergic to the common mold spores found in such situations; diagnosed by a doctor due to symptoms at the time).  Paul Davis Restoration didn't even treat the entire affected area, although they said they did. We had to call them back the next day, as our tenants informed us they had only removed and treated an area behind one section of the cabinets. They came back the next day, same thing; they didn't detach all of the cabinets and left a section remaining untreated. At that point, we were out of time and authorized our new contractor to remedy the mold behind the remaining section. Paul Davis Restoration is claiming they are not at all liable for the charges our new contractor imposed upon us for the mold remediation services provided. I felt that calling them back the second time was more than enough of an opportunity to comply with right to cure and we needed to get the new flooring installed that day.  So now we are left with a bill from installing a new central air system because USAA wouldn't pony up the dough and they won't even enforce their 3-year guarantee to their preferred network provider which doesn't even come up on any list in our area as a network provider for that area. It's enough to make your head spin. What recourse does anyone have against such large companies as USAA or Paul Davis Restoration? Even with irrefutable proof and supporting documentation from tenants and professionals in the same field? How is it that an insurance company can bid lower than what it costs to repair or replace such things and get away with it? All I can say is stay away from these three companies. They have way too many deceptive and unfair trade practices to account for.",326

In their bungling attempts to prevent credit card fraud they have on six occasions put my card in decline mode because they suspected it had been compromised. They never, ever let me or my spouse know this in advance, so we are always embarrassed by it. I've even written the president of USAA over this, and, like the rest of his staff, he doesn't give a damn.  The only thing I've ever been guilty of is paying my account in full each month and never being late. Because of business use I charge about $50,000/year. Today I told them to close the account, credit my cash rewards, and to never, ever contact me again. I'm so angry about this that I'm thinking about leaving USAA overall. They are not the same organization anymore. They are just another greedy financial services company, not the one that was created by army officers to protect their brother officers.",340

Here is my situation and problem with them. I had an active USAA auto insurance policy and platinum MasterCard for about 4 years. I never missed a payment, I never paid late. My credit score was 720+ at the time. Things were great, but then took a turn for the worst. My ex-spouse began wrecking my credit and I began to struggle heavily financially during our separation process. I was forced to switch insurance providers to save money.  After my credit score plummeted, my credit card limit was severely reduced, and then shortly after, canceled completely. When I tried contacting USAA customer service, I was largely placed on hold, transferred from department to department, and overall given the runaround. When I did finally get to speak to someone, I was basically told that I was dropped because of policy, regardless of my situation and the fact that I am a former, decorated, honorably discharged Marine. In the end, my service to my country, my financial history with the company, and my personal situation at the time didn't matter whatsoever. The moment my credit score dropped below a certain threshold, and the moment I began to experience any financial difficulties, I was let go when I needed the credit card the most.

They took pics of his truck, but no one came to take pics of my car. As for the statements, mine was more of a fishing expedition because the second she heard that I had a flashing yellow signal, the claims lady drilled me on what I did to avoid the accident. If she asked him why he proceeded to cross the intersection even though if he would have looked to his right, he would have seen my car approaching...that was a factor that didn't matter to her. That question would clearly show that either he wasn't paying attention to traffic or he has no regard for human life or the safety of others because his reckless action put someone else at risk of getting hurt or killed.  It was clear that everything else I told her wasn't relevant. I was told by her that the investigation would take 3-5 days and that I should just go and get my car fixed.

The other driver told me that he told the truth in his statement and still admits that the accident was his fault, but I received a letter denying the claim stating that I failed to yield-- a letter that was dated the same day that the other driver gave his statement. That wasn't even a day's worth of investigating. It is clear that their claims process is completely unfair and biased and motivated by greed. In a court of law, a judge usually accepts a defendant's guilty plea, but USAA ignores whatever information that should result in a payment.

Now, I will inevitably win since I have pictures of the incident but I thought I would take this time to tell you how USAA responded to me as the other party. My wife and I were parked in a parking spot with the engine off. Yes, you read that correctly. I made a claim and basically they ignored me and since I wasn't their customer, they decided to throw me under the bus. I do have a good company and they will be subrogating USAA based on the notes, pictures and the conversation they had with the USAA customer. What is funny is when I called USAA (only sent with an original acknowledgement letter) the representative (gatekeeper) said based on the damages, they determined it was 50/50.  I never did get a call back from the supposed adjuster of the claim. What a surprise, huh? So I told the representative after he gave his sales presentation about how it was a 50/50 accident (they still haven't seen the pictures which will be a surprise to them in arbitration) that does he realize the car was parked with the engine off? He is silent. I just told Larry not to worry about it. I will proceed with my own carrier or in small claims court and I recognize he is doing his job. USAA is no different than most of these carriers when dealing with party B. They are going to look at the bottom line. I just expected more from a supposed reputable carrier. Is USAA now Mercury Insurance? I understand the ways of the world. If you can't pay out in obvious situations, then what hope is there for an at fault system. Just make it no fault system since USAA isn't going to do the right thing anyways.  Remember, USAA didn't follow up with a 50/50 letter and also didn't even ask for any evidence I had to present. These guys were playing games on the initial phone statement. I guess they didn't like my direct statement. The purpose of this complaint is if you get hit, prepare to file a small claims court action, hire an attorney or go through your carrier (hopefully you have a deductible). Don't expect favorable treatment no matter how obvious the fault of the incident. Shame on USAA. I should think about starting my own insurance company, charge people for insurance, don't pay out to the other party if they are not at fault and then charge my own clients an accident surcharge.

My husband drives a state vehicle to work and I work from home. Very little mileage is put on either vehicle. So why do we have to pay so much?

I had set up my mortgage to be paid by the 15th back in August, 1 day before a late charge would assessed by my mortgage company. I have been paying a mortgage for the past 30+ years and never had an issue, or late charge. The past 10 years or so I have used bill pay at a local bank that was taken over so I moved to USAA bill pay; I had been a member of USAA for the past 3 years prior to using the bill pay feature. I did check each payment mail date and posting dates and each was on time or early, until this one and it was 2 days. I had given myself a buffer of 1 day, just in case. I received a call from my mortgage company on Tuesday Feb 16th telling me my mortgage payment was not paid. I contacted USAA who told me it was sent out on the 10th and slated to arrive on the 13th. It didn't. I was not concerned, because I knew there was a guarantee and they would pay any late fees up to $50.00. USAA customer service agreed with me. I was WRONG! It eventually arrived on the 17th to be posted on the 18th. You guessed it, they charged me $45.34 the maximum allowed by my contract. The mortgage company did not budge and claimed my bank would not pay it either, unless I set the payment up to be paid by the 1st of the month. Ahhh, hello! I should be able to choose to pay my mortgage anytime I choose to before a late charge is assessed. But not here. Apparently they have a rule (USAA does) that they forgot to inform us all about. They claim they pay late fees ONLY if the auto pay info is set up ""correctly"". I would assume ""correctly"" means account numbers, addresses and arrival dates as it asks for on the bill pay set up form. Wrong again, ""correctly"" now means they get to say when the payment delivery date should be, and it MUST be the ""statement due date"", not the ""pay by"" date that incurred a late charge. So, I don't know about anyone else, but a huge bill like a mortgage gets paid prior to a late charge, that is the ""due date"" for me. Why give them 16 days (over a 1/2 a month) in interest benefit? If my mortgage company would deal with electronic payments, this would be a non-issue, but they want access to my checking account for me to pay electronically, and if my financial institution can't get it there on time, they enjoy the late fees (free cash). I thought USAA had my back. I guess I was wrong... yet again. They refuse to reimburse me the 45.00 late charge on the basis I did not follow the fine print that is not even available for me to read. So, they got your back, as long as they can talk the business you paid late to rescind the late fee, and well Mortgage companies want that fee and USAA doesn't want to reimburse me. They did state they need to reword the bill pay set up and make the fine print available to customers in the future, so I paid the price for them to know how to set up and interact with their members. I believe I should have been reimbursed for their failure to make public their process and identify the ""payment received by date"" MUST be the ""due date"" on the statement, or they will refuse to be responsible for late payment... what a heartless company that make the customers pay for their learning curve. I think most likely the issue was, they incorrectly set up the delivery date to accommodate the weekend and Monday holiday. They allowed only 3 days to mail to the east coast from Texas. I think 4-5 would have been more appropriate. Sad, very sad USAA, you’re not very ethical on this issue. This was your mistake that cost me 45.00. Sad.

I called USAA about a week later to get the loan. The customer service rep told me they could give me a rate that was about 1% higher than what they quoted me. I questioned them and told them I wrote down the previous loan amount and asked them to listen to the phone conversation which they recorded. They ended up giving me the rate they originally quoted me. Fast forward to recent weeks. I viewed rates for excellent credit and applied on a Sunday through the internet. Within 5 minutes it gave me a tentative quote. The rate was higher so I called USAA. The customer service person told me that she cannot give me the excellent credit website rate because the computer generated rate is what I get. I asked her why and it was like pulling teeth to get an answer, which she got off the computer generated response. The responses were so ridiculous. I have never been told and denied higher rates for those reasons in 30+ years. The customer service person finally told me that if I can get a lower rate at another bank, that they could probably lower my rate to what they offered. I said ""really"", that makes no sense. (How about giving me the lowest rate right now). Right now I feel that the loan department is a shady operation. The bottom line is that I will go elsewhere to get a loan.",399

When I told the adjuster this she told me, ""You should have sold it then."" I told her I DIDN'T want to sell it then or now. I just want what I pay them for. I was told by USAA and the adjuster that they DON'T use Book Value or Loan Value on a vehicle, that they use Cash Value. The way the come up with Cash Value is that they called two little hole in the wall used car lots and ask them what they would give for the vehicle. They never looked at the vehicle and they told the adjuster that a hard top value was the same as a soft top value. They also said it didn't matter that it was a 4x4, that that would be the same cost as well.  The adjuster told me that the reason she did that was because they COULD NOT find a comparable vehicle to mine because of what it was and the condition. You can find 100's of regular Tracker and that’s the quote price they gave me, it was not for a vehicle of comparable value.

She had a different insurance company and did not want her to switch. So I never changed, but just on the quote they started up renter's insurance. I called in 4 times to cancel. So I decide to start auto insurance up with USAA a few months later. Don't know why. So to fast forward, I had USAA take the payment out of my bank USAA to make payments. I travel a lot for work so when I come home sometimes do not see all the mail. I have let the insurance go a few days past payment date but never owed them too much. So they cancel my insurance because it is too difficult to pull it from the USAA checking account. I call in and complain and have to fight my case with 2 managers, because I was in the wrong. I am sorry that I trusted you. So they state that they will keep my insurance and keep the bill the same. Silly me I accept that and two months later see my insurance bill has went up $100 per month. So I call and they send the case to the CEO's office. I talk to Sara today and she let me know that they still have been billing me for renter's and would be trying to figure out how much to give back to me. Also she stated my bill will be higher because of the cancellation that they did not take out of my account that they have with them. What a bunch of monkeys.

Anyways, we ended up divorcing after about three and a half years and it was an ugly divorce. She made me sell the house I had always dreamed of, the one we built and got because I was a service member and we bought it with MY VA Loan! She also took every piece of furniture, music, picture, down to the grill outside from the house. The divorce also resulted in me filing bankruptcy in 2000. But one thing I did not put on the bankruptcy was the credit card because I trusted USAA credit card services and they were good to me and my ex-wife and we opened this USAA credit card account together, let that be known please!  In USAA, usually you have to be affiliated or married to a service member, which I was again. So 10 years later now, I still have the USAA credit card and I have been paying the monthly payments on it every single month! Up until recently, I got a letter in the mail from USAA stating that per my request, the card ending in 4#'s, which was NOT my card number but must have been my ex-wife's, was being closed due to fraudulent charges on the account, which never occurred!  So I called USAA, told them what I received in the mail and explained to them I never requested this account to be closed and that I was/am the primary cardholder of the account and that I was with military so how was it possible that she was able to close the account. Also they did NOT verify her correct information. She gave them her name, of course, but that she lived in the city I currently live in with my current wife, which is not true, so they (USAA) closed the account altogether on fraudulent charges/accusations!

She called up one day and was able to close the account with NO verification of her information. She is NOT the primary cardholder and she was not with military!

There are issues about the difficulty to talk with a human ""who can give results"", but the primary problem I dropped USAA auto insurance and contracted with another company is that USAA used a scapegoat rip-off company to determine the value of my totaled car and would only approve 80% of its value. Rather than determining the value by an average of three respected appraisal books or similar local car sales, CCC has their own method of appraisal and adjustments for mileage, condition and location which is legal robbery. That is why USAA will now sell you an add to your policy that gives you a new car buying bonus if your car is totaled of an extra 20% of its value (as determined by CCC).  That extra 20% amount may get you back to the actual value determined fairly. I was ripped about $2000 in the settlement that was not negotiable.

As of 6 months later, Auto Injury Solutions has succeeded in delaying paying most of the medical claims by my providers. The delay includes requiring extra work from providers significantly more than other insurance companies and then rejecting claims based on minor technicalities of how the computer forms are filled out, then having a supposed medical expert who did not know anything about the patient or condition and without corresponding with the doctor then ridiculously ruling that a treatment was not required. This seemed to be harassment to get the provider to give up collecting from USAA and filing against the patient. The current USAA medical claims process is so bad that some providers may not accept future patients with injuries and have USAA insurance coverage. USAA has delayed closing the claim now for 6 months which has in turn delayed Shelter Insurance (the final responsible company) to not pay the $450 they owe me for my rental car reimbursement. I cancelled my USAA policy on June 30, 2015 and have contracted with another company for slightly better coverage with a total increase in yearly premium of 82 cents/year for two cars. Because of the good warning in this website by another submitter, I did not submit this complaint or threaten USAA that I was changing insurance until my new insurance was approved and complete. I appreciated other inputs on this site to learn in February 2015 that my problems with USAA were not unique to my claim only. For lowest total insurance cost I changed both auto and homeowners policies. I counted the complaints on this site in 2015 for a comparison of auto insurance companies I evaluated.",424

When I logged into my account, I found that another named person appeared on my account. The person named was my son, or so it appeared.  However, there are more than one person with that name in my family and I was not sure who it was, so I asked to have his name removed until I could verify the correct identity. USAA refused and this led to the questions why someone could have access to my secure account without my permission, without having served in the military himself, and why I had no authority or right to protect the security of my account, or makes changes to my own personal profile if I so desired. The answer was; once a member establishes an account, he becomes a member for life, because the military record becomes linked to others in the family who may want to become members, even though they have not served, and no matter what their age, or status. I was aghast at the possible infringements to my personal information, identity, and assets, over which I had suddenly lost control.  I requested cancellation but discovered that I was never cancelled and my account still remains to this day. 1 year later I checked to see if I was still able to log on to my account, and the results surprised me. Not only was I able to log on, but everything was as before, including the name of the person I wanted removed. I immediately tried to cancel, but could not.

Last year I made a claim for repairs, only one repair, but was told that it would be created as four different accidents as they did not appear to be related. I was told to pay the deductible on each. After these repairs, I was laid off and moved insurance from USAA. USAA claimed that I had an outstanding balance for the remaining part of the year. Recently I decided to move back to USAA from my previous insurance company. I contacted USAA and was told by the customer service representative that they would cover me once the outstanding balance was paid, and once I paid six months premium in advance.  The representative told me the amount that would need to be paid for the premium and even sent a note confirming this. I was told that the documents and the premium notice would be online within a day. On trying to get this, I found that I was locked out of USAA.com due to the unpaid premium. The premium was paid, but USAA said that it would take three days to reinstate the site access. Three days sounded a bit strange and funny enough, it is the time it takes for a payment to clear.  I went onto the website yesterday to pay the six months premium and could not find it. I called the customer service line and they said I would have to talk to their underwriting department. I was informed that the policy was declined due to the claims that had occurred, while I was with USAA. USAA continued to insure me as the payment of the outstanding premium indicated. The underwriting department claimed that the customer service representative should have checked the claims background before they quoted the six months premium. This is not my issue. I had an expectation of insurance, USAA took the money for the back payment and now they are backing out of the insurance. I could have accepted an increase in premium or change of coverage, but USAA say that they will not review this. It seems to me that USAA misrepresented the expectation of policy issuance to get the back premium. I had thought that this was a company with integrity, that is what they say, but now realize that this is not the case.

At the beginning of April I was due a renewal. I took a look at the bill for the renewal and was in shock. USAA wanted $712 to renew, and $450 a month for premiums. I spent 15 days in communication with USAA about the excessively high premiums, trying to get them lowered. I obtained quotes from The General, Progressive, & Geico for the exact same coverage. All were right around $260 a month, without the high first-time charge. I explained to the customer service personnel with USAA that these were the pricing I was getting for the same insurance and that it was absurd that USAA would charge its members almost double what other companies are charging. One rep tried everything to get a lower cost; he got it down to $425, and to stay loyal, I was going to pay. However, the day came to pay, (2 days later) and the cost on that quote had gone up over $480. Upon hanging up the phone with that rep, I called Geico and purchased my coverage through them. I was able to get more coverage through Geico than I could with USAA as I had whittled my policy down at USAA trying to be able to afford it.  Overall I am saving over $2,500 a year by switching to Geico, I know it sounds cliche, but it's the truth. I have sent emails, Facebook posts, & private messages to USAA about the unfair charges.

I will soon be making that change as well as I have also whittled down that policy trying to be able to afford it. My deductible with USAA is $2650, with Geico it will be $1000.

Now to the Personal Injury side of things. Elizabeth again seems to know more about how things happen in injury claims than I do. According to USAA guidelines they will not pay ongoing medical treatment for injured parties in an accident. The parties are required to pay for all of their treatment themselves and in addition USAA will not settle on a claim until all of the injured treatment is concluded. So in their system an injured person who cannot afford medical treatment to get better will not ever reach the conclusion of treatment and get better or back to their original condition.

Though quoted an interest rate, APR, projected mortgage payment and closing costs for a 15yr fixed mortgage (without notice), they changed to a higher interest rate offer, APR, Discount Points and closing costs. The original projection and unexpected new dates were always considerably higher than other lenders and when I asked them why, the pre-qualification personnel said it was because the interest rates had changed and that we would inevitably be saving by taking on a 30yr mortgage at a higher interest rate if we were intending on selling the home within ten years. This company has ultimately cost us time, money, embarrassment, distress and probably the loss of our home purchase. I do not recommend them by any means. If I could rate them with no stars, I would.

They have done nothing but delay, stall and avoid taking care of our claim. My son was in an unfortunate accident and my car was totaled. From the initial interaction after my car was towed, the service and response was slow and unresponsive. I had to call the initial adjuster just to get the estimate started over a week after my car was towed. We waited yet another two weeks before anything was being done. We were told the car would be fixed with about 13,000 in damages and would be fixed by the end of the month (about 2.5 wks to complete the work).  We were then informed two weeks later by a voicemail that my car was deemed a total loss. And because they left the voicemail, notifying me of the total loss our rental car coverage would be ended. The offer I was given by the total loss department was significantly lower than the value of my vehicle. I made multiple phone calls to the new adjuster I was assigned with responses taking several days to more than a week.  I complained to the supervisor and was told that USAA uses a variety of methods to communicate with customers. I was further informed that if I didn't like the value of my vehicle I could hire my own valuation company to do a separate estimate. They had several of the premium package missing from the estimate on my car I had to send multiple emails and phone calls outlining my cars detail. Meanwhile almost 2 months after my car was totaled the issue is not resolved and I have no rental car coverage and no vehicle to drive. I truly believe they are using stalling tactics to get me to accept their offer. The injury adjuster assigned to my son's medical care has never even called.

Approximately 4:30 pm the USAA Insurance company lady calls and starts harassing me saying ""are you going to take the rental back today?"" I told her ""my car was not ready why would I take the rental back"" and the Enterprise Car Rental closes at 6 pm. She said that I was then responsible for paying the extra day rental. I said ""why was I responsible?"" She said because I choose the shop and the work order was for five days. I was incredulous! The USSA insurance company says it is not their responsibility to give the consumer information because I choose the shop. My insurance company AAA said they never heard of such a thing that the rental was covered until the car was ready. I called USAA multiple times and got my insurance to call also. They do not return calls, they disconnect you, say extension numbers you have already used are invalid and will not let you speak to a manager.

He also said he just wasn't paying attention when he rear-ended us. Anyway USAA was insistent we get a quote while on vacation in the town that the accident happened. The quote said 250 dollars damage but they could not tell if the impact bar was bent without crawling under the vehicle. USAA wanted to investigate whether the gentleman had insurance or whether the person he bought the car from happened to have not canceled the insurance on the car. Completely understandable! So after vacation we waited a month. Got in no big hurry so they could investigate.  My husband contacted them around July 10th and they stated there was no insurance on the vehicle by either the new or old owner so we could proceed with getting it fixed and getting a rental (we had underinsured & uninsured coverage & rental car coverage). We proceeded and put it in the shop and I obtained a rental. After a couple of days in the shop and no word my husband called and the impact bar was bent so they had to order it. He called the next day to check and the shop said that USAA is giving them the runaround and not wanting to pay. My husband phoned and USAA said ""upon further investigation"" the gentleman that hit us now has auto insurance so under the law they have to contact the insurance company to see if they will pay for the claim.  My husband asked if they were for real. He said the guy did not have insurance on the day of the accident and the insurance company he has now is not going to pay for an accident that happened before he took out coverage. USAA said it was the law they had to contact the insurance company to see if they would pay. My husband asked if they would pay under the same circumstances and he was told absolutely not because there wouldn't have been coverage at the time of the accident. HELLO!!! So USAA said since our car was fixed we had to get it out of the shop and return the rental car immediately because they would quit paying at that point since our car was fixed. The total of the repair was 548 dollars. USAA paid 48 dollars which left us to pay 500 to get our vehicle back and USAA said they would reimburse us after their investigation. FRUSTRATING!!!",483

It contracts with towing companies all across America, allowing it to negotiate lower rates. Agero is the biggest roadside assistance provider in the industry (per a Popular Mechanics article: Who Really Provides Your Roadside Assistance?) I know this because I had plenty of time to do internet searches and read other USAA customer reviews and comments while trying to get a towing service to my husband stranded only 5 miles away.  Here's the ""Service"" provided to us by USAA's roadside assistance contractor AGERO: 5:56 PM Called USAA for their towing service, which we’ve paid for a few years and never used, and was transferred to Agero. "" Press ‘1’ for first call."" ""Press ‘2’ to follow up on first call."" (Not a good sign.) My husband’s key wouldn’t turn in the ignition so he was stuck 5 miles away at a local market. A woman took down the information and said I’d soon get a text to confirm the tow truck is on the way and estimated time of arrival. (No text came.)  6.49 PM called Agero again, and punched “2” since this was “if you are checking on the status of an earlier service request press ‘2’”. (They must get a lot of repeat calls to put this in their phone tree.) A man took the call, checked my ""file"" from the initial call and said he apologized and that the previous dispatch hadn’t been made and he’d call back personally after he did the dispatch himself to confirm that it had been done. (No phone call followed.) Got online to check reviews for USAA + towing while waiting. Not looking good. 7:09 PM called Agero again to check status on the tow truck's arrival. Pressed “2” since this was still another follow-up call on the initial request for a tow truck. Put on hold for a long time. More apologies, the woman said she had arranged with a tow company and they would be calling me with the tow truck company information and an estimated time of arrival. I asked for the name of the company and was told M&O tow company. (No phone call followed with an ETA.) 7:34 PM called Agero again to check on status of M&O tow company – since no phone call followed – another lady took the call and said the previous lady was on the phone nearby and she was still working on getting a tow company to come. That the previous tow company M&O isn’t coming. Call was switched to another lady, Evan, and she said she sees my file says Countrywide Towing is coming, with an estimated time of arrival of two hours. (End call/hold time 7:45 PM.) NOTE: It took nearly 1 hour 45 minutes for a tow truck to finally be dispatched. And, apparently this is the only service this business provides. 1) Taking calls from people needing service, 2) calling a tow company to make the arrangements, and then 3) letting the customer know who is coming and when. That pretty much sums up what this business provides. You’d think they would be able to dispatch a tow truck quicker than 1 hour and 45 minutes. 7:44 PM voicemail left by Carl, the man above in the 7:09 PM conversation, he said it took him a while but he has made arrangements for a tow truck to come. (Found this voicemail message later after my husband got home.) 7:46 PM received text from Clark & Howard tow company, ETA 8:17 PM. 8:03 PM received automated phone call from Agero? (from Tennessee) that help is to arrive in 15 minutes. 8:14 PM received call from driver William with Countrywide Towing; he is in the area and will drive by to see if the other company has come. 8:21 PM Clark & Howard tow company hasn’t arrived, even though ETA was 8:17 PM.  8:29 PM Automated phone call from Tennessee to see if Clark & Howard tow company has arrived. “NO” – put on hold to await a customer service representative. 8:32 “experiencing high call volumes, this is the last message and we will continue to play music until an agent is available . . .” . . . some minutes later was speaking to their representative. At 8:37 we noted that Clark & Howard were now 20 minutes past their ETA and still hadn't shown up. My husband called and said that Countrywide had arrived. I went back to the rep and told him. I also mentioned to the representative that it took 1 hour 45 minutes for a tow truck to even be dispatched. He mentioned that their company takes over a million calls in order to provide excellent service. Wonder how many of those calls are repeated efforts to get just one tow truck actually dispatched.

When I asked why I had not been notified immediately they say ""well, we sent you a notice in the mail"". So let me get this straight. I tell them ""You issue me the wrong policy to begin with and make changes to my account without my consent?""

I then asked why the other driver did not have to exercise courtesy of the road due to my already being 80% out of my parking space and having already blocked 1/2 of the drive-through area. Ms. Victoria then continued to compare my situation to a vehicle at a stop light and me pulling out into the adjacent traveling traffic creating an accident.  I explained that there are laws and statutes mandating the right-of-way at a stop light or sign, but that a parking lot is an ""enter at your own risk..."" (as stated by the states department of transportation) and that ""... drivers must exercise right-of-way and courtesy of the road."" I then asked that, simply because I was already almost completely out of my parking space and already blocking 1/2 the drive through, if the other driver did not have to exercise courtesy of the road or the fact that I, at that point, had the right-of-way. Victoria had no answer for me but continued to state ""... in my personal opinion, you are at fault based on the statements and damage to the other vehicle."" I had mentioned that ""... In any other parking lot or situation, when a vehicle is already more than halfway out of their parking space, you (the driver pulling into the drive through) normally have to stop based on courtesy of the road and to avoid accidents because you have the better and bigger visual."" She again had no answer or response except to repeat her previous statements.  I then asked, ""Since there are no laws or statutes about right-of-way, why was courtesy of the road not applied or taken into account with my claim when coming to a determination? There are no laws or statutes about courtesy of the road, yet we, as drivers, still have to abide by both!"" Victoria had no answer, except to say that ""... In my opinion and based on the fact that you were the driver backing up, the other driver had the right-of-way, no matter how far out of the parking space you are."" Don't ever go with USAA! In their opinion, no mater how far out of the parking space you are, if someone hits you or isn't paying attention and/or exercising courtesy/rules of the road, you will still be found at fault based on unwritten rules and courtesies that everyone has their own opinion on! We have been loyal, accident- and incident-free customers for five years now, and we have, in the meantime, continued to see rising rates with no explanation! So, in closing, no matter what, common sense and courtesy goes out the window (according to USAA); and you can hit anyone or anyone can hit you and you'll win and be found ""not at-fault,"" as long as you're the driver in the drive-through in a parking lot. It doesn't matter if you're speeding, driving through the white painted lines on the cement, or not paying attention to your surroundings and other drivers. You will get off scot-free, simply because ""you have the right-of-way."" Common sense, anyone?  I only wish I had an attorney or lawyer to help me fight this common sense claim and to help my name be cleared! I will now have a claim on my driving record which will result in higher premiums and insurance costs. I am also looking at a possible suit from the other driver or insurance company. I am stuck with a ruined bumper, unless I am willing to fork up the $500.00 plus to get it fixed at my expense.

If you are involved in an accident and it is a he said she said type of situation, then you need to forget it because it will clearly be your fault unless you have a witness. I had a driver cut in front of me and slammed on his brakes. I barely tapped him in the rear. There was no damage. He first demanded cash then threatened to call the police. I let him. Incident report was filed and USAA said that it was my fault for rear ended the POS scam artist driver. Anyhow, few months later, that POS claimed other related personal injuries. That's what USAA gets for not investigating that con artist. They raised my rate and I was so upset that I switched carrier. I finally came back to them years later.  I was happy with them until I got into another accident. A female driver swung her big ass SUV wide into my lane during a busy morning rush hour. I was barely moving because all cars were just stopped for emergency vehicles with their loud sirens on. That gal did not stop because she was in the slow lane and was driving faster than anyone else trying to slow down. I did not realized that I hit her because I first thought that I was rear ended and was trying to look back in the rear mirror. I then realized that it was her SUV because I saw the fresh paint damage on the side, towards rear driver corner. At first, I thought that I drifted into her lane. However, my front tires were all in my lane and noted that her rear driver tire was in my lane. I honked at her and tracked her down since she was trying to make a right turn to escape. She did not want to exchange driver license and insurance information.  I threatened to call the police and that's when we exchanged info. Her young daughter was in the passenger seat and I noticed that her cell phone was on her seat. I reported this to USAA and they investigated and decided that it was my fault. Again, since the damage was on the side toward the rear end; therefore, it was my fault. Now every time I drive and sense that a vehicle is encroaching into my space, I am getting a flashback. I live in SoCal and drivers here are reckless. They will do whatever to create an accident. I am thinking about installing a camera in my car to record everything because without a witness you will be screwed and USAA will not defend you.  I had Nationwide previously and they are the same way. A lady turned right in front of me from a left turned lane. They faulted me 50% and would not go after the other driver even though it was clearly her fault. Anyhow, we had to take her to a small claim court and got a witness. She finally gave in and agreed to pay before we even got to court. She paid out of pocket so she got away without being blame for being at fault and we got stuck with the 50% fault on our record.

I was wrongly accused of this vandalism/arson crime, lied upon by the VBFD investigator, and misrepresented by investigating officials. Ten months later, I am still fighting with USAA to replace my SUV. It's been 10 months 10 days, or over 310 days since my Mercedes Benz GL450 was maliciously vandalized/burned and to this date, I have not had any kind of positive closure to this loss from USAA. I was told that there is an ongoing investigation and no decision will be made until this investigation was complete.  On 5/1/09, I completed an examination under oath or rather what was an interrogation under oath. My privacy and rights were violated at this examination under oath, questions were being asked about my life, my work, and my wife, all unrelated to the loss I suffered on November 5th, 2008. I was treated by the attorney that USAA hired like a criminal. I kept a copy of the entire session of all the ridiculous questions and assumptions being made by this lawyer who represents USAA.  USAA is deliberately delaying closure to this loss simply because I was wrongfully accused of this crime. I was vindicated, yet no action has been taken to replace my SUV. I've been an honorable serving member of our Navy for over 11 years, of which USAA has insured me for at least 8. I never cheated, or committed a crime, and I never imagined going through such an event. It would have been nice if USAA, the company that claims to truly care about its members had done a proper investigation in a timely manner, realized that I am not responsible for the damages to my vehicle, and bring to a closure the worst experience of my life.  Mercedes Benz Financial, and Phillips Mercedes dealership, have both been willing to do a Substitution of Collateral on my behalf. Negotiations were made to replace my SUV but this agreement is history or at a standstill because USAA is basically dragging its feet. Months after the loss of my SUV, USAA found it fit to continue deducting insurance allotments from my bank account, yet my vehicle was totaled in November 2008. I received first communication in January ‘09, heard from the attorney March of ‘09, and I'm still in the same position. I am very disappointed and hurt by their actions.  On July 31st, I was rightfully acquitted of all charges, and until this date, USAA has not paid to repair and or replace my SUV. I ask that someone in USAA's chain of command attend to the concerns of this Active Duty Sailor and make some quick decisions and do what's right. I have no means of transportation at this time, yet I'm paying for my vehicle every month for the last 310 days. I can no longer deal with the injustice and unfair treatment from USAA. On June 25th, 7 months after USAA told me that my vehicle was declared a total loss, they sent me a letter denying my claim and told me to go pick up my car from the junk yard where they took it back in November, and that they have no interest in the vehicle. I had my vehicle towed to the dealership for repairs. USAA removed my car from the dealership, telling myself and personnel at the dealership that it was a total loss, yet they tell me in June of 2009 that I need to go pick up my car they have no interest in it.",532

After the accident we sat on back of his pickup and waited for the police to make the report. The other driver was charged with failure to reduce speed. I told him that it should not be a problem because we both had USAA, boy was I in for a shock. I might mention that when I was younger I also believed in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy. The car I was driving had already been hit two years prior by someone who did a u-turn on a one way street and hit me when I was attempting to merge. I had already check in that direction before I started pulling forward when the front of my car was sheared off. The car's front end had frame damage. The car had around $ 3,000.00 in damage but did not want a car with frame damage. I had purchased the car new and did not want to spend time having the front end checked all the time.  After the car was repaired I had it serviced at the dealership who told me that the front end was out of alignment and needed to be corrected. They would do it for about 90.00. I guess that gives you an idea of how good USAA certified repair shops are. I then took the car to Firestone and paid $179.00 for a lifetime warranty on the front end. When I took the car to the same repair facility after it was rear ended I signed the paperwork for them to check the car. I was told there was $6,500.00 damage and frame damage to the rear. I called USAA and told them it was not worth fixing and not to do the work because it was not going to be worth the money they were putting in it after the repairs and it would have frame damage to the front and rear of the vehicle. I got a bill for $90.00 for car rental because I hindered the repair process.  When the car was finished I took it to the dealership that did the repairs and was told they could only give me $4,000.00 in trade. I asked why and was told the car had frame damage and the car would have to be whole sales because the dealership could not accept the liability for selling a car with frame damage. I guess that USAA and the dealership do not care about their customers.  So the next issue I would like to address is the medical. I complained about a back injury as a result of being rear ended. Since May of 2014 I have been in therapy, had an mri, cysts drained and had back surgery. USAA has not paid a thing. They are still checking paperwork. I am disabled, can not work and all they can say is they are waiting for paperwork from the doctors. I have been told my heart function is 20-25% and I have a 50/50 chance to be alive in March 2020. I guess that they just plan on letting me die to solve my medical. I had USAA for about 45 years. I guess there is something about their motto ""you're a member for life.""",536

They kept sending us paperwork to fill out saying they did not receive the title. We sent that in several times and finally my husband called them and told them that he had never seen the title and they should contact Toyota as he had done. The problem was not with Toyota's lending dept. or us. I just hope and pray when this car is paid off that a title will come to us.

I was forced to demand the independent appraiser route with an independent umpire as laid out in Mass State Law. Most licensed appraisers have contractual ties to USAA by being on their approved list of repair shops. I found a very honest appraiser who was told by a USAA appraiser manager, ""We have never had a problem with you,"" and insinuated he could be taken off the list. My appraiser felt threatened and was forced to withdraw. Eventually, I was forced to take the USAA offer because of economic conditions. Their technique was to stall, lie, bully and intimidate over roughly $500. My experience was just terrible. They made no attempt to be honest, but they do say it’s a lot.

The lady who hit our car was insured by USAA. This accident happened on a four lane intersection on Beechmont and Five Mile. On that day, me and my daughter were traveling through on Beechmont crossing the intersection with a green light. We had a solid green light. The woman who hit us with the BMW, thought on the other side of Beechmont that she had a green arrow, which she didn't. We had witnesses and she was also sighted for failure to yield right of way.  It happened on Thursday and they didn't do anything until I called USAA and talked to Jimmy **. Still when I called him, he gave me the runaround. He lied and said, ""Oh, I will send someone to look at the car"" but he never did. My daughter was rushed to the hospital. Her head hit the windshield of our car, her nose bled badly everywhere, the airbag popped and powder from the airbag got into her eye. Ambulance came and took us. She had bruises on her leg, arm, and my neck had pain as well as my right shoulder. I have a picture of what my 15 years old daughter's eye looked like. She could not see that day and have problem when breathing.  So now, he denied our claim and tried to say I don't have enough evidence to prove that me and my daughter drove through the green light. There is a witness in my favor and she saw me going through the green light. I know this is hard to believe, but it's true. I feel like something needs to be done. I'm not letting him, Jimmy **, do my family like this. If that lady paid any attention to were she was turning, we would not get hit. Now, we're left without a car and I'm not giving up. I want justice for my rights, I feel very stress and this has caused family problems.  I didn't know it was this bad reputation of a company. No wonder why they don't want to pay, but they will pay and as God as my witness, I would not lie about me driving through a green light in the middle of the intersection. I just had a bad feeling when I was told about her insurance because of the name USAA. I have never really heard of this insurance till now. Five kids and no car, where are the good lawyers at? I need one to help me fight this USAA. They can't do this to people out here who are struggling. While he has a nice car and having a good life, some people out here are left with nothing.

I thought nothing of it initially since I drive an SUV. A few days later I began to hear a whining sound coming from the rear of the vehicle. I thought to myself it is probably just road noise and paranoia and put it out of my mind. After a couple of weeks I could not deny that there was damage done to the rear of the vehicle. I took it to a mechanic who looked it over and told me the rear differential was going out and that my vehicle was not safe to drive. I asked him if that could have been from hitting the pot hole and he asked me if I had had any problems with the rear prior to that incident to which I answered no. He asked about the details and as I explained he kind of smiled and told me that yes, it is due to that incident. He said that with my model vehicle (which I will not identify due to fear of being sued) it is not an uncommon problem. He used to work at a dealership and had seen a few instances of the type of damage I had due to similar circumstances.  I priced the work that need to be done and almost passed out when he told me it would be over $4000.00 (USD) to repair. I said OK and left there looking for a second opinion. After having the car checked out for a second time (at a fee of another $100) and explaining the pot hole incident the mechanic gave me that same smile and said pretty much the same thing the other mechanic had said and quoted roughly the same price. I first contacted the city to complain and seek relief to the damage done to my car (after all, why am I paying taxes if not to have decent roads to drive on). The representative I spoke with explained that I drive on the roads at my own risk and they can not be held liable for any damages to my vehicle.  Fast forward a couple of months to a conversation I was having with a friend of mine (yes... contrary to my wifes beliefs I do have friends) he asked me if I contacted USAA about it. I told him no to which he then explained that since I have full coverage (and I do mean FULL coverage) it should be covered. I thought what the hay, and called them. The lady I spoke to initially told me that what I had described should be covered and but that the final determination would be made by the adjuster. We made an appointment and on the day of the appointment the adjuster called and said that he would be there an hour early. Normally not a problem but we had another appointment earlier in the day and knew that we would not be home that early.  We explained that we would not be home so we needed to keep our scheduled appointment. He tried to say that he would not be able to come by at the prearranged time and that he needed to come by earlier to which we explained again that we could not be there that early and that the original scheduled time had to be kept. With a very short acquiescence he hung up. We made it home and he took one look at the car which was parked in the drive way the whole time and said he needed to see it up on a lift so we had to find a garage that we could take it to and reschedule with him. I did not argue and made the arrangements. I called him to let him know when it could be done and he did not sound happy about it since it was at noon (lunch time). He again gave me a short agreement and hung up.  Two days later I drove the SUV to the garage (which I should not have been doing but I don't have the money to have it towed). He showed up late, looked it over and spoke to the mechanic that was assigned to the vehicle. I asked him if he wanted to go for a drive either with me or with the mechanic (the mechanic had offered to take him for a drive earlier) and he basically ignored me. After he was done with the inspection and speaking with the mechanic I asked him what the next step would be. He said he had to do some pricing and see if he could find the parts and a ""salvage yard"". At the mention of ""salvage yard"" I balked and asked him why he would be trying to find my parts at a ""salvage yard"".  My SUV is 4 years old and has a little over 50,000 miles on it I could not believe he was suggesting putting a junk yard part in my SUV. He pretty much blew me off and said he would be in touch on Monday (since it was Friday). Shortly there after I called USAA to find out what their policy was on replacement parts since my adjuster had disregarded my questions and blew me off. I explained the situation to the lady I was speaking to and asked her if it was USAA Standard Operating Procedures to procure replacement parts from a ""salvage yard"". She explained to me that any car over 2 years old would be subject to parts from a ""salvage yard"" before looking at any aftermarket or dealer parts. She also told me that she knows my adjuster and that he is one of the best adjusters at USAA. When she told me she knew my adjuster alarms started to sound in the back of my head. We traded a few more pleasantries and hung up.  That Monday I get a call from my adjuster, he tells me that he spoke to other mechanics he knew and described my issue and they said that the problem I am having could not have happened from me hitting a pot hole. I waited a day to digest the information he gave me, spoke to the mechanic again and, armed with the information the mechanic gave me called USAA again. I asked to speak to a manager to which they put me through to a very nice lady in another division of the claims department. I explained to her the whole scenario including a couple of conjectures on my part as to why the claim was being denied. I asked her how it is that he can describe a problem to another mechanic that had not seen my vehicle and take their word over the mechanic that had seen, inspected and spoke to the adjuster about my car. She told me she would look into the matter and get back to me.  She then put me in touch with the adjusters manager who feebly tried to back up his adjuster. By the end of our 45 minute conversation he told me that he would have the adjuster look at it again. All I had to do was take it to a shop and have them drop the rear off so that it can be inspected. And oh by the way, he said he was denying my claim because he did not see any damage to the undercarriage of the vehicle. I quickly replied, at no time did I claim my SUV bottomed out, it was a pot hole. I then pointed out that this is a not the reason he told me he was using for denying my claim.  I called the mechanic AGAIN (he has been very nice and helpful) and asked him if the adjuster had mentioned anything about damage to the undercarriage and he said that he had not. The adjuster had however asked if there was any damage to the rim to which he told him there more then likely is but he had to take the tire off and put it on the wheel balancer, but since he was not being paid to do so he would not (quite understandable). He told me that just because the rim does not look damaged, it does not mean that it is not. It more then likely is damaged and is more then likely the cause of the wobble in the back end when driving but he could not be definitive about it without taking it off and checking it. All indications are that the damage was done when I hit the pot hole.  I made a few phone calls to see about having the rear dropped off so it can be inspected by the adjuster and the reply I was given was along the lines of a chortle. No shop is interested in dropping the rear end off so that the adjuster can inspect it since there is a possibility that the adjuster will turn down the claim. Now if I want to pay the $700 or more to do it they will gladly accommodate but they will not be responsible for the rear end and if it can not be put back together or back on for any reason I would have to pay the storage fee ($150 a day plus a fee roughly $200 a day for tying up a lift).  So I again called USAA and spoke to the manager I spoke to the first time (the nice one) and she again said she would call me back. She called me yesterday and said that USAA will cover one hour of Diagnostic time to have the vehicle inspected. She said she is going to find a ""USAA authorized garage that can fit it in if I don't have a garage I want to use. I mulled it over and told her I would call her back and let her know if I can't find a garage that will do what is requested. I began to do my search online and came across this web site and am the better for it. I now know that I do not want to take my vehicle to one of the ""USAA authorized garages"". I have the name of a place that comes highly recommended by a couple of friends that I contacted and is willing to do what is asked. Now let's see if USAA is going to honor the agreement.

This is the same bank/company, mind you; but apparently they have to mail me a check, which I deposit in my own bank. Then I can pay them (losing the interest on that money AND accruing more charges in interest on the credit card in the meantime).

I called USAA and questioned why they reported I had 2 insurance claims when I stated I did not want to make a claim and why did you report on my C.L.U.E. report I did. The lady with customer service stated it is the law, they are required to report any claims regardless of the payout.

Then after multiple attempts and rude customer service and supervisors hanging up on me, the problem still exists. This C.L.U.E. reporting to LexisNexis is not a law. It is a service these insurance companies sign up for so other insurance companies will base your rating off this report. Also employers use this to insure you on their equipment ultimately costing your job. Not to mention this will also raise your homeowners insurance by reporting this. So by reporting this information, USAA will ultimately force you into staying with them because when other insurance companies see this, they will give you a higher rate.  Their answer to this was, ""Well, USAA is not using this against you"" but that doesn't matter because other insurance providers or employers are causing a defamation of character. Also I have accident forgiveness and USAA put a on a claim that I didn't want to pursue as me at fault when I was ran off the road.

In January 2015 had a incident with my two dogs got out of yard and when a woman was walking her dogs. I know it sounds real bad and it kind of looked bad! But they were really more jumping and holding the dog then biting the other dog, no blood but, still very scary. I pulled my dogs off, asked the lady if she was hurt. She said the thought she may have broken a finger, I told her I was so very sorry. A man came over and they walked away.  Not long after that a man pulled up, then soon my husband and then the police! So cut this shorter the police ask me what happened then went to the women's house to get her statement and check the damage. The police and the women's husband come back. The husband tells me he's take his wife to the hospital and the dog to the vet and will I pay for the bills, I reply of course I'll take care of and gave him the info he needed. He left. I got a ticket to go to court for the incident. Just so you all know I knew it was all my fault and I was horrified about the whole incident and I owned up to it. A couple weeks later I went to court and to my amazement my case was excused with no fines, I don't know why it just was. I had been keeping my eye out for hospital and vet bills in the mail but, nothing then, a letter for an attorney came! The lawyer informed to call my homeowner insurance to get in touch with him. So I did USAA claims dept. The gentlemen asked me about the incident, told me not to worry, he said that's what insurance is for and that he'd take care of everything and if he needed anything else he'd call me back. I hadn't hear anything for weeks then, last week I got a call from USAA that my policy came for review and that they noticed that I had put in a claim in January 2015 and want to know what happened.  So I told her the story, she said she would talk to the panel and give me a callback. In 5 minutes she called back with the news that USAA will not be renewing my policy! I am not saying I'm not at fault but is this not why we have insurance! This is the first time I put in a claim. In the 8 years that I have had my dogs they have never been out of our fenced in yard! And though I take the blame for this it was a repairman that had left the gate open! I just didn't think to check it! That's why I blame myself! USAA should be ashamed the first time and they canceled my policy all those years they took my money and felt protected! My dogs have never ever hurt anyone before this incident. I felt compelled to write this so people know that if they decide to give your hard earned money to USAA this can happen to you as well!

It was agreed that I would make 6 payments of $383 per month to bring my credit card current. As I made the payments, I became aware of two disturbing facts. First, each payment was made on time, and yet, USAA took an additional $25 each month as a late fee. I called and talked with an individual in the Executive Relation Division about this $25 late fee. The lady reviewed my payment history and confirmed each payment was on time. She decided to call the collection department on my behalf. I was informed that USAA wanted $400 per month and I refused, thus the late fee. I asked the executive relation representative if this made any sense that I could tell USAA no to their request and set my own payment. She replied no. Something was wrong. The second disturbing fact is I had debt protection on my account from day one. Event after admitting they made the mistake, USAA made me continue making the $383 payments. The debt protection company refused to own up to their reasonability. I kept calling USAA, asking for help. They made the mistake; they should help me.

"645",41690.9,"GREG","Golden","CO",1,"auto",39.651919,-105.240955,"I would like to share with you my experience with USAA's Auto Claims Department. My complaint centers around several issues as follows: 1. USAA practices as they pertain to repairing a car vs practices when declaring a car as totaled. 2. USAA deceptive letter insinuating that I was not communicating with them. 3. USAA letter informing me of my rights under Colorado law and the manner in which it arrived. 4. USAA practice of declaring a car's actual value vs replacement value. To begin this is the second time in the past 15 years that I have been involved in an auto accident. The previous accident the claim was handled by Auto Owners Insurance. I totaled my 2001 ford F250 diesel pickup truck. Auto owners handled the claim promptly and they sent me a check for an amount that allowed me to choose from many similar year and models with similar miles and features. This claim was handled completely over the phone with no letters or repeated unnecessary phone calls. The following information gives the timeline as best I can remember for my experience with USAAs claims department: On January 28, a client of USAA struck my car in a parking lot of a golf course when I was inside having lunch. We exchanged information and I was called within an hour by a representative of USAA. At that time I felt it was only cosmetic damage and told the USAA rep that the car was drivable. He informed me that it probably take several weeks to get it into the shop as Denver had experienced lots of snow lately. On January 29th I found that the car had more extensive damage than it first appeared. Specifically in addition to the physical damage to the outside of the vehicle the front passenger wheel had been damaged in a way that allowed the power steering fluid to leak out on to my garage floor. With no power steering there was no driving the car. That day, January 29th, I called USAA and informed them that the car was not drivable. They arranged for a rental and told me someone would call to arrange pickup of the car. During the course of the day I had two separate calls arranging for car pickup asking the same information. I was able to pick up the rental car after 5pm on that same day On January 30th the car was picked up from my house. On January 31st I received a call from USAA reviewing my car and all its options. It was obvious to me that the person calling had already seen the car or had a report from someone who had seen the car. That same afternoon I received another call from a different USAA agent asking the same questions about the car and its options. On February 4th I received a voice message from a USAA rep. In his message he said unfortunately the 99 Infinity had been deemed a total loss. Additionally he asked that I return his call and if he did not answer to not leave a message but to hit 0 so a team member could help me right away. He stated that they do this so they will not miss calls and get this resolved for you as soon as possible. That day I called back and got a different agent who reviewed the car specifications and options with me. That afternoon I got another call from an entirely different agent asking for the exact same things that I had gone over with the agent that morning. Late that afternoon I got a call from USAA representative again, giving me a claim number (**) and informing me that the car had been valued at $5000.00. At that time I discussed with him the condition of the car and the recent repairs that I had done to the car. He asked for receipts for the repairs and said he would email a letter to me. I sent the repair bills but did not here back from Mr. ** On February 5th I called again and was put in touch with yet another person a Mr. **. I explained to Mr. ** my situation and re-sent the bills I had sent earlier while we talked. He said he would have en estimator look at them. After a long wait Mr. ** said he could add another $30 to the total. That night I did research and discovered only about 20 1999 Infinitys available for sale in the US, with only 1 in the Denver area. The average price of these Infinitys was about 5,777.00 with the one for sale in Denver listed at $8,800 On February 6th I again called the provided phone number and got another team member who again knew nothing of the previous emails or information. After speaking with him again at length, providing the same information again, and being placed on hold again at length, this person made me another unreasonable offer increasing the value by another $54 and informed me that the provided rental must be returned by the 7th. That day I sent the first letter both by mail and to the email address they had provided. On February 7th I got a call from someone named **. She stated that she had been asked to review this information by her manager, a Mr. ** and that she could raise the value of the car to $5476.79. I told her that it would not be sufficient to replace the car that I was driving and would have preferred to have had my car fixed. She stated that she could only go by the industry guidelines and that she could only provide the actual value of my car not the replacement value. I asked if the rental car could be extended up to the point I received the check and she informed me this could not be done however, I could make arrangements with the rental car company to keep the car at a reduced rate that I would be responsible for. That afternoon I returned the rental and went car shopping. Through the weekend I looked at many different cars none of which were anywhere near as good as the one that was totaled by USAA's client. I finally settled on a Volkswagen Passat that cost me $6500 out the door. On February 10th I received the Fed-Ex with the USAA check. I placed the check in the bank and made arrangements with the dealer to pick up the Volkswagen the next day. That afternoon I got 2 letters from USAA. Both letters were dated January 28th but were not received by me until February 10th. One stated that I was not communicating with USAA and the other informed me of my right to have my car repaired at a shop of my choice which is what I wanted done in the first place. Unfortunately by this time I had already picked out and committed to purchasing the Volkswagen and did not have faith that I could retrieve my car and have it repaired given the experience of the past week in dealing with USAA On February 11th I paid for and picked up the replacement Volkswagen. That afternoon I got a voice mail from a Ms. **. She stated that she was a special assistant to the CEO of USAA and that I should call her back. On February 12 I returned Ms. ** call and we spoke about my experience and about the car and its replacement value. She said she would look into the situation and review my case and call me back. I told her I would send her a letter explaining my situation if she would give me an email address which she did. On February 18 I got a return call but was unable to reach Ms. ** until the next day February 19th. When I returned the call on the 19th Ms. ** informed me that she reviewed my case and again stated that their offer is based on the value of the car not on the replacement value. She said there is nothing more she could do for me.  Addressing the points I made in the beginning of this letter, I feel that USAA was more than willing to drag their feet when they thought that my car was drivable. Once they realized that my car was not drivable they did everything possible to complete the claim and issue me a check going so far as to Fed-Ex the check. It is very obvious that they postdated those letters stating that they could not get in touch with me and that I had the opportunity to repair my car. I believe they only sent the letters after they had the title to my car. I repeatedly heard the phrase car value vs. replacement value. All I know is that by no fault of my own on January 28th I was driving an Infinity Q45 and now I am driving a Volkswagen. I provided them all the information they needed to see that I could not replace my Infinity with anything close to it (Lexus, Acura etc.) with the check they issued me. There does not seem to be much more I can do other than commence legal action against USAA's client. I am asking that you help me by pressuring USAA and ensuring that they do not do this to other people.",645

Since I knew I was not using the card, I never looked at the statements just made payments every month. Had the total amount paid off in 11 months. Before making the last payment checked the latest statement found that interest was accruing. Called USAA and they said that was the credit card that I accepted.

I have been a member with them for 15 years. Back in 2009, when I had to file a claim due to damage to our roof from a major windstorm, USAA sent one of their contractors to access the damage and make their recommendation back to USAA. The recommendation from the USAA contractor was the entire roof needs to be replaced. USAA denied the request and only paid for the roof to be patched.  In September 2009, we had another major storm that came through with high winds and more damage was done to the roof along with a flood inside the house from the roof. Another claim was filed and again, USAA contracting company recommended the roof to be replaced. USAA would only pay for the roof to be patched and the damages inside house. December 2009, another major storm with high winds and the roof was damaged again by shingles being removed and lying throughout the yard. Another claim was filed and USAA contracting company again suggested that the entire roof needs to be replaced.  This time after arguing with USAA for two months on this issue, they agreed to pay for the roof to be replaced. Now if they would of listen to their contracting company the first time, we would not have had to file three claims. Due to their neglect, we, the customer have to pay for it by being dropped and having to pay a higher premium with another company. I was paying $1,959 a year.

"649",39856.63,"GREGG","Olympia","WA",NA,"credit",47.0176423636364,-122.822890818182,"I logged on to my account to see how much left I have on my fixed rate loan that is supposed to be at 7.45%. When I viewed account activity I see $159.00 interest has been tacked on to my account. I had been paying extra on this account for MANY months. Validation of this charge was requested and I was informed that becuase I had a loan I had to pay interest and that it was in my contract. If said loan had been paid off in January 2009, then using the flawed logic USAA applied--USAA would have been able to come back and collect interest owed on the balance from September to January where interest was not collected--which in fact is not true and would be seen as a bank error. In reviewing the account and the documented FACT that interest had accrued every month up until I began paying extra, their explination of this bogus charge was not an accurate description. This was a bank error, not a customer error.Now lets take a look at what USAA customer service representatives (rep) did and did not do to assist me in making my decison to choose another institution. First the rep did not admit that USAA made a mistake and that interest had not been charged for approximately 149 days.  Secondly I do not need condescending e-mail double talking on how interest is calculated. I know how interest is calcualted. Little hint to the inexperienced customer rep--junior, this isn't the first loan I have had. Third before USAA zapped my account of an additional 160 dollars, no one from USAA called or sent an e-mail ahead of time, to notify me that this had happend and USAA just chose to raid my account, even though I was NEVER behind on my loan. And just as a gimme here you may want to ask in the future if a payment had already been sent off (which it had). My bank records indicate that a payment was sent on the 6th of Feb. Funny--How difficult would it have been to treat me with some respect, call me and tell me that out of the 500 dollars I sent in $160 dollars would be applied to interest. Nifty thought process huh? Fourth when the rep says things like ""When you make principal payments you are simply paying down the principal balance however no part of the payment is applied to the interest portion of the balance."" It should read ""USAA and its computer program did not apply the correct amount of interest and it was only recently we discovered this discrepancy. We are sorry for the inconvience for not notfying anead of time before gaining access to your account. We do understand you have acted responsibly and have made every effort to pay off this loan in a timely and responsible manner. We truly apologize for the disruption"". Now I am sure that as a rep of USAA you could possibly put a pleasant spin on this, however I must ask you to dig deep, place your functioning brain cells on whether an additional 160 dollars out of my account (without notice), may have a short term negative impact on my budget. Understand one thing IT IS MY MONEY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE!!!!!!!! USAA has FAILED miserably to meet the mark of customer sevice and customer satisfation in our household. And yes, I am aware that with other insurance companies I may be paying higher rates, however if this will ensure that USAA will keep it's greedy money grubbing hands off of my account I would be more than happy to pay a little more. In short as a good customer this is my notice to USAA.....You're fired.On an additional note, my bank has records indicating payments sent on one date and said account with USAA not being credited for an additional 4 days. Before USAA would credit my account, I had to send them an e-mail from my bank account indicating that payment was made. I know that per day it is only about one dollar in interest, but imagine if they were doing this to 10,000 customers per month. that would be 1.4 million dollars a year of erroneously reported interest accrued.

I got my AMEX credit card and my car loan through USAA. I submitted a dispute while I was out of the country for work for my AMEX, I was told it would not be a problem to send the dispute paperwork out of country. I was never advised of the option to process dispute paperwork online. I never received the paperwork and the dispute put my card over its limit (it was a sizeable dispute). USAA then lowered my limit without telling me and refused to address the dispute error on their end saying I could not prove that I asked for the dispute to be sent to my address out of the country. I told them to go back through the recordings that we all hear about every time we call our banks. They told me that they do not hold the recordings that long!?! At this point I lost a contract worth literally 70K because of my inability to travel, as I used my credit card specifically for this purpose and they reported me as over the limit and began damaging my credit. I tried several times to get them to remediate this error committed by USAA. They refused and as my credit was already damaged, I stopped paying. I then fell on hard times due to the loss of the contract and the crash of the markets (I am a high end technology consultant and could not find work for over 6 months). I went through my savings and this impacted my ability to make payments on my car. I called them the day before my payment was due and they had closed early, causing me to not get approved for the deferral. At this point I stopped paying on my car as well, my credit was already destroyed and I had nothing to lose. I finally got a job and was not able to even log into my account to deposit my paycheck as they had locked the account due to my financially distressed lack of payments (the app accepts check deposits, but is tied to the online account which they locked in an attempt to strong arm me into making money appear out of thin air).

Even ** (the adjuster) acknowledged the terrible manner in which this claim was handled and apologized for it, but refused to take any action to make amends and you are simply reconfirming that, at USAA, incredibly and inexcusably sad customer service has become the norm and that USAA has, in fact, lost its way."" When I failed to receive any sort of response from, or on behalf of the USAA chairman or president/CEO, I finally decided, after 58 years, to vote with my feet and take my business and insurance premiums elsewhere. I discovered, to my regret, that I should have taken that step years ago, if not because of unacceptably poor customer service, then for economic reasons alone.  My new homeowner's and auto policies, with competing insurance companies, for precisely the same coverage limits, will save me $272.00 per six-month period on the auto policy, and $60.00 a year on the homeowner's policy. But, again, my motivation for finally cutting my ties to USAA was not financial but abysmally dismal customer service. USAA has grown so large that it is unable effectively and efficiently to manage itself. As it grew from a small automobile insurance company, that was founded by military officers to serve the needs of other military officers, into a giant financial services conglomerate, it completely abandoned its founding principle and sacrificed its member/customer-focus to the maximization of its profits, and the customer be damned. Yes, USAA, you have truly lost your way. Good-bye!",667

I was able to come to a complete halt with 6-8 feet between me and the preceding car, which incidentally, rear ended the car in front of her. We had stopped a good 3-5 seconds before being hit, and driven forward several feet. USAA says that their insured says it was my fault so they refuse to deal with me.

My husband has been with them for 4-5 years. We loved them, until today... 1st: Last month the Army decided not to pay hubby (while he was out of the country doing required training) until after he got back a full month later. That mixed with moving (our lease was up at the same time) messed up our finances big time, since I was the only one bringing in a check for a whole month, and he wasn't being paid, every bill got pushed back. When he did get paid we had to move and pay the main utilities plus late fees and did not have enough to cover the payment. So we had to pay the car insurance late and both months at the same time with this paycheck. But they don't allow that unless it is in THEIR time frame. We called and told them that well in advance and they said we had to pay both months by the 14th and we said we don't get paid until the 24ish.  Our deadline came on the 24th but our paycheck came the 25th due to processing issues. We called the 25th first thing in the A.M to pay and restore coverage and they tell us that in order to get reinstated we would have to pay a $600 fee! We cant be trusted because this is the 2nd time this has happened. The 1st time was this time last year for the SAME reason (the Army can choose to pay how and when they wish and there is nothing we can do about it). Even though we tried to explain the situation and warn them well before the deadline, even going as far as to show them proof of his orders and everything, they won't budge on this fee. The last time they made us pay $200 fee in the same situation and we knew they would do it again, that is why we called in advance. Now we have to find car insurance elsewhere or pay the $600 as punishment! Screw you USAA, I may just bank elsewhere too.  You are supposed to be supporting military members, not punishing them. For that month my husband was gone I had to choose between food for the kids or paying USAA. Apparently I should have just paid them instead of buying food. 2nd: We have full coverage on a car we are leasing. I had a tire blow out on the freeway and the speed forced the tire scraps to hit the fender of the vehicle a couple times before I could pull over (all the way from the HOV lane). The fender was damaged. So, I file a claim to get it fixed. USAA sent me to a shop in their network and tell me that the comprehensive deductible would apply.  The estimate to repair the fender is $586, and my deductible is $500. SO basically I get a flat tire, which is completely out of my control and end up being responsible for 95% of the cost to repair. Isn't the full coverage car insurance supposed to protect me? Needless to say the fender isnt getting fixed because I dont have $500 sitting around. Their service is ridiculous.",671

I took it over for my own when I was 21 and when I was married at 30, my husband and I almost fought over if we were going to go with USAA or his insurance company, however I won and USAA it was. We received multiple letters trying to ""verify"" my married name (it got quite annoying after the fifth letter), however we thought we went with ""the best"" company. About 2 1/2 months ago I was in a motorcycle accident that was not my fault, and the other driver received a citation. I called USAA and advised them of the accident and they took some information, however I advised them that I was going to claim this through the other driver's insurance -- they told me I could not do that and that it would be better if I just let them handle it, so I did. I dutifully waited for some information about what to do to get my bike and other belongings fixed, but nothing. I called USAA back and asked what was going on. At first, they said that I needed to get a copy of the police report to them; I advised that when I was 21, I did not have to do that, but they said it would speed things up, so I did. The next call was stating that they could not get a hold of the other person's insurance company, so I called them. Yes, they were rude and advised me that they would handle things in their time as well. In the mean time, I had taken my bike to a repair shop and they advised that it would be $1800+ to fix the bike. I called USAA and told them where the bike was at and the appraiser could see it there. About 10 days later, I got a check from USAA for $129 ($629 minus the $500 deductible) with no other explanation or even an appraisal. I called USAA for an explanation on the small check; I was advised by the adjuster's MANAGER that that was all they were going to pay and that the reason USAA's rates were so low is because they DO NOT send out ""frivolous"" paperwork (I was only asking why the appraisal was not sent with the check), but I reminded her of the 10 letters I had received from them to verify my married name. She got rude and snippy with me. She also advised me that there was damage on the right side of bike (which there was none) that was not part of the accident (I do not know how they would come to this assumption). I called the repair shop where the bike was at and they said that NO appraiser had seen the bike. I called USAA back and advised them of this and they assured me that they had; when I asked how they knew this and how come the appraisal was so low, the MANAGER told me she did not know, because the Appraiser DID NOT work for them! Do they not pay them to do this work? I finally called an attorney who stated that they would handle all of the matters and to let USAA know that the other insurance agency would be paying the damages. I am not one to sue anyone, however I could not take the insurance games anymore. We got insurance through another company and advised USAA. They told me that our refund check would be issued after it goes through a billing cycle. After 1 1/2 months, I called USAA to say that we have not received our refund check and the woman advised that she could issue a check right now and that we did not have to wait. That was over 2 weeks ago. I called today and we were told that the check was issued and sent out, but that they would re-issue the check and we would have it in a week. I doubt we will get it.

I was recently in an accident (day before Thanksgiving) with a USAA customer. The USAA customer immediately took fault because he drifted into my lane which caused me to veer off of the road and hit a wire cable post. My car was deemed a total loss, and USAA gave me a low-ball estimate which is nowhere near the amount it would cost to replace my vehicle. A representative (Raquel Natal) told me she was aware that the amount being offered was not enough to replace my vehicle. She said USAA is only legally required to offer ""actual cash value"" for my car, not replacement value. I then checked Edmunds fair market value, which is comparable to actual cash value, and Edmunds estimates my car's actual cash value as being $1000 more than what USAA is offering me. I thoroughly viewed the report (prepared by USAA) Raquel Natal emailed me regarding my claim, and there are many flaws in the report. For instance, a lot of the damage to my vehicle caused by the accident (e.g., dent in rear door, rear bump scratched) USAA marked as damage PRIOR to the accident. Also, the 17 cars they compared my vehicle to cost significantly more than what they are offering me, but they ""adjust"" the value my subtracting several thousand dollars so that the car is worth significantly less. For instance, one of the cars they compared my car to had more miles and fewer features, yet USAA subtracted almost $1000 because that car was determined to be worth more than mine. Shouldn't it be worth more? ? Bottom line, even if USAA is only legally required to offer actual cash value, the way they determine actual cash value is ambiguous, subjective, and in my opinion fraudulent. I have been trying to negotiate with USAA, but the claims adjuster dealing with my case, Claudia Moreno, has not returned my calls. I have called her five times and have left four voicemails over the past two weeks, and she has not called me back. I contacted Paul Marking, a claims manager, and any time I asked him a question regarding the claim on my vehicle, he gave me a snarky, unclear answer and tried to run circles around me with his insurance jargon. Also, I explained how this accident has caused me a lot of emotional distress because I wasn't able to spend Thanksgiving with my family, and my rental car was taken away (by USAA, of course) too soon, so I have been without a vehicle for over a week. He showed absolutely no sympathy for me, and was actually quite rude. In conclusion, I will mostly likely have to take legal action against USAA. I highly discourage anyone considering USAA as an auto insurance company to use them as their insurance provider. Find someone else!

I called my insurance company and was told that I could file a claim and the amount that I would receive for the bumper would be $500.00, however, my policy would increase in cost to me $500.00 each year for the next three years. Needless to say, I dropped this company and became a customer with State Farm and remained with this insurance company for more than 25 years. I changed agencies when we married and that is when all of the troubles began. In the past few years, I noticed my husband struggling with his accounts, both insurance and banking, in the manner of agents providing false information, instructions that confused the matter at hand and a system of policies and procedures that left him bound to this company with little or no modern day banking advantages. I told him that USAA's banking system was archaic at best and the manner in which the company was handling it's customers was much like that of a banking system found in the post 70's systems in China or Russia. We never received any assistance when we called, the agents were extremely invasive by continually overstepping their bounds as a bank representative and whenever an agent could muddle a process within our banking experience, they did so with a manner of entitlement and pleasure. It seemed as if the agents made up policies and procedures as they spoke with us and when we became indignant, they seemed to reach for measures within the USAA P&P's to punish us with extreme restrictions that might be placed on a newer customer with a very shady past. Mind you that my husband and his father both banked at USAA for over thirty years with impeccable records showing no need for concern for fraud or suspicion. Recently and the final straw, USAA placed a hold on a check we deposited from another bank account my husband and I share. He called to make certain this was acceptable and that we would not have any problems doing so. We were encouraged to do so, so he scanned the check and made the deposit into our account. When he scanned checks for deposit, he used a stamp that he had used for twenty years to endorse the check which he had done for many many checks before.  Stuff hit the fan and agents were clucking and pecking like hens in a chicken house on fire with wolves outside the door!!! The check was placed on hold even though we received an email stating it had been posted and USAA had already drawn the money from our other account.. When we called the bank an agent stated it was placed on hold because he did not sign the back of the check. The deposit was to be held for 3-5 business days. We had checks coming through on the account and our greatest concern was a check we just gave our daughter to pay for some of her college expenses. We called USAA and the agent told us the check would not be taken off hold and that they would not honor the check to our daughter. At this point, we are trying to place money into the account to cover the check in the form of a wire transfer from our secondary bank into our USAA account. USAA refused to capture the wire transfer and let the transfer ride 24 hours before they deposited the transfer into our account. We again contacted the bank and were told that the check for our daughter had been paid and the NSF fee was reversed. My daughter checked with her bank to see if the check from us cleared and it had been returned. Fortunately, we at great cost sent her cash through money transfer agency and she received the monies and placed it into her account before the check we gave her bounced!!!  We called USAA the following business day and was told that our initial check was now on hold for TEN business days and that the wire transfer had been deposited and the check of concern was indeed paid. My daughter received from us twice the money she needed. That was okay, she needed the extra money anyway. Throughout the process of trying to provide this bank, NO LONGER OUR BANK, with everything we could to resolve a very simple banking issue, the agents seemed compelled to do everything possible to make this experience bitter and unresolved. The agents even seemed to take GREAT PLEASURE in making this difficult and used all aspects of banking regulations to provide us with all disadvantages in trying to amend our account. SADISTIC practices at their fullest were used to make us squirm and feel helpless. VERY GESTAPO like practices used within this financial institution! Oh and we forgot to mention that because a check from this bank was received from us for our insurance policy a day late, they cancelled our insurance and ensured us that we would be reinstated as a new member with new accounts for all of our insurance policies, even our home owners policy!!!!! So I believe that USAA Federal Savings Bank is scrapping for financial gain in any manner possible to stay afloat. We purchased a new insurance policy with a local agency and he advised us that three other people contacted him within the same week who were prior customers of USAA. Our agents at our local bank told us they also had experienced mistreatment from this bank and chose to use other avenues for their loans and banking needs! USAA is taking firm steps in ensuring they present themselves as a very pristine and ethical banking institution, however like the Gestapo, if you do not agree with them or criticize their methods they most likely will send out the German Shepherd's to trail you and inflict financial injury! I told my husband many times that I never had problems with my banks as he was with USAA. The bank has very few branches and this ensures you cannot resolve banking issues within a minimal amount of time; you can make deposits but only over the internet or (and this makes me giggle so much) through the UPS Store; and USAA uses the regulations set forth by the FTC, OCC and Federal Reserve to their advantage, not the consumers. USAA seems to be closing long term accounts to keep any monies invested in insurance premiums by cancelling the policies using any unethical reasons possible. Of course this is my experience and opinion. I actually told one agent that I believed the gates of hell opened up beneath the bank and the vile scathing creatures that emerged replaced the humans that once serviced the customers using this institution! Take my words of advice or ignore them but I recommend based upon our experiences recently that you when see the smoke from the cinders burning beneath this bank and turn the other way. Don't listen to the sirens placed in the media to lure you in, because you most likely will be treated as we were but not until you have paid them with years of loyal commitment and monies paid into their system!",693

They cannot verify the account until you login to their multi-level security account and request two deposits made to your account to verify it. USAA then (hopefully) sends you two different temporary deposits within 1-3 days. You then hope this has happened after three days; go to your local branch within 30 days (and also before the next billing date); obtain those deposit amounts; return to USAA website and enter your three levels of security login information; find the manage accounts feature; click on the non-verified account and enter the two values from your bank. Now hope and pray the verification posts, stating that it is verified.  I tried this three times with failure. This is just an example of unethical strong-arm business practice to coerce members to use USAA banking services instead of an outside bank, and they KNOW that. Then their website login is like they are running NORAD. Except the people at NORAD actually use encoded cards and fingerprint scanners (cheap and still the best). Why don't they just require a simple fingerprint from a $19 fingerprint reader available at any computer superstore which plugs into a USB port? I guarantee no one has ever hacked a fingerprint, which is why they are used for drug dispensers, like Pixis and by federal agencies.  No, let's just add 6 more levels of numbers, symbols, arbitrary shapes and sequences of things that can be hacked, and ten minutes of hassle for you to enter it as you look it up in your digital password keeper app. Then, good luck finding anything on their convoluted, multi-level website. I know they are located in a foreign country called Texas, but this is like going back to the 1980's. It's no wonder that their company is so archaic. Their CEO is a retired Army General good 'ol boy republican with (no doubt) dinosaur thinking (which also runs the rest of our country) and keeps America where they want it: At the bottom of the list with most everything.

USAA me to their referred *preferred* body shop. The body shop determined the damage to my car was $5,373 and determined the cash value of my car to be $4,329. The body shop left me one voice message stating the car repairs exceeded the value of my car and that they were contacting USAA (even though USAA’s *preferred* body shops estimate states they discussed the estimate with me; which did NOT happen). I received a letter from USAA stating they were totaling my car. Unfortunately, my car cannot be replaced for less than $8,500 (but that is a different topic). I reviewed the estimate and noticed they were charging me $1,010 just to replace the hood on my car; rather than repair the hail damage. The estimate looked inflated to me. I contacted USAA asked if could get another estimate and was informed by the USAA representative that it did not matter if I got another estimate. They had already decided to total my car and there was nothing I could do about it. I stated that I did not want to total my car and was told that I have two options total the car and receive the $4,329 payout or I could buy my car back for $2,500 (a car that cannot be replaced for less than $8,500). I contacted one independent repair shop. The gentleman gave me an unbiased estimate to repair my car for $3,007 and explained the estimate. His estimate to repair the hood was $475 of the total repair bill (a difference of over $500 when compared to USAA’s *preferred* shop). I showed him the estimate from the other shop and he agreed it was inflated. I asked USAA to accept my estimate of $3,007 and NOT total my car; USAA refused. USAA was determined to total my car and they sent me $2,500; since I decided to keep my car. I argued the damage to cash value of the car: $3,007/4,327 = 69%. I asked the USAA representative what percentage of damage to value they used to determine if a car is to be totaled and he refused to answer me. I pressured him and asked the same question at least 10 times before he finally answered with 70%. So, the damage to value of my car is below their threshold and should not be totaled. Think about this… If they're reversed and USAA decided the repairs estimate should be $3,000 and my shop determined the cost to be around $5,000; USAA would have only paid the $3,000. This is an *unfair business practice*. USAA knows this and they also know that my only recourse is to spend thousands of dollars on legal fees and take them to civil court. I am confident I would win, but the cost is not worth it. I visited a few local car dealers about my experience with USAA and learned that the auction value of my car was over $5,000. USAA wanted to auction my car for $5,000, while giving me only $4,329 (minus my deductible). USAA is making a profit at my expense. My driving record is impeccable. I have not received a traffic citation in 34 years and I have not been involved in a vehicle collision in 32 years. And USAA refused to work with me…",699

He called and they said there was more fraud. See a theme here? Now this was real fraud, no money was taken from our accounts but they were frozen for almost two weeks! No money for two weeks!

The interesting thing is they say this breach of my information was not from them.

I was given the same song and dance I get from them on any other rate increase; the increases were due to the high number of losses in my area and the future anticipated losses. I asked the customer rep if USAA was going to refund me the excess premiums I paid if the anticipated losses did not occur. You know what the answer was.  I then asked the customer service rep where I could obtain copies of the loss information they submitted to the Alabama Insurance Commission for the past five years to justify the rate increases and he told me they were public records and I could get them from the state insurance commission website. I went there and, of course, nothing was found. I sent an email to the USAA homeowners insurance division asking for that information. I received an email back from Mr. ** which stated the information I requested was proprietary and USAA could not release it to me.  I can't believe that USAA can submit rate insurance requests to the state insurance commission any time they want to and that information be confidential. Seems to me they are making it proprietary for a reason; so they can squeeze every penny out of their policyholders and we won't know that they are just sticking it to us year after year.

"721",39994.06,"JAMES","Cocoa","FL",NA,"auto",28.3929416,-80.770366,"On June 15th 2009 while traveling on business, a deer had struck the front end of my car, a 2006 V6 Mustang with the pony package option. This vehicle was customized with a Turn 1 CS6 appearance package from Shelby Automobiles valued at $8000. The vehicle now inherited a Historical collector status to the Shelby Enthusiast. When I contacted USAA to initiate my comprehensive claim, USAA directed me to have the vehicle towed to a USAA authorized Star shop in the Nashville Area. The car is registered and insured in Florida. When the car arrived at this ""Star"" USAA authorized repair facility, the rep immediately started on the appraisal process. The rep who works for the dealer body shop is also by coincidence a USAA authorized appraiser. The appraisal on the vehicle was grossly overpriced causing USAA to make a determination that it was a total loss. After more research and a second appraisal from a Ford dealer body repair shop, I discovered the original appraisal was valued at $2700 more than the Ford dealer appraisal. The new value to repair the vehicle at ford is now $5571.00. This is well below the 75% margin of the appraised value USAA came up with for my vehicle. That is my next problem. USAA's appraised value on the vehicle is $2000 less than the NADA value and $3000 less than Kelly Blue book value. This is for the basic value. USAA is not allowing for the Shelby appearance package and suspension upgrades. If USAA totals my car, I will be about $6000 negative and upside down in my auto loan on the vehicle. Also with not the greatest credit, I will not be able to get into another car. The extent of the damage on the Mustang is the grille only was pushed in and damaged the radiator, A/C condensor, radiator support structure, left driver side headlight, broke the cap off the power steering reservoir, and damaged the driver side front fender due to impact with the deer’s head. The small deer’s body missed the hood and the front bumper cover. The USAA dealer appraiser included the hood and front bumper to be replaced in the estimate, also repairing the front left fender at 10 hours of labor. Ten hours of labor alone could purchase 2 front fenders and be installed and painted for the price of repairing one fender. The fender cost the dealer $169 to replace. The frame of the vehicle is undamaged and is in complete repairable condition. USAA has been handing off my claim to specialist after specialist, and still coming back with the same answer as the vehicle is still a total loss, even though I had provided over 40 evidence photos of the extent of the damage including tear down inspection photos. It proved without a reasonable doubt that the hood, and front bumper do not need to be replaced at a cost savings of over $2000 for parts and labor. Each time I prove the car is not a total loss, USAA comes up with some other reason that they say they still can total the vehicle. I asked if canceling the claim and paying for the damages to the car myself is possible and USAA says if I do that, they will still declare the vehicle a total loss and I still need to get a salvage title and approval from my lienholder to do it. If I do this, I will still be in debt to my lienholder, have one vehicle that needs $5600 on repairs to be placed back on the road and basically no way to get to work. If I give in to USAA and let them total the vehicle, I will be in debt; $4000 for the Shelby upgrade to the vehicle, plus $2000 to my lienholder of the vehicle for a total of $6000 in debt. USAA will then own the car and I have no way to get to work. If I elect to total it and take possession of the vehicle, God only knows what USAA will give me as a buy back value. I am sure it will result in USAA breaking even and me taking the entire cost. What am I paying insurance for? USAA was formed to provide US Army-commissioned and warrant officers with insurance.

Whereas, if they would have just addressed the issue as soon as they heard it would not have lasted 2 years and a lawsuit. Now, present in September my roof was leaking so I decided to call USAA and file a claim. It took a month for an adjuster to come out, in the meantime we got hit with a hurricane and made the damage worse. The adjuster filed it under my regular deductible of $1,000. It took another 3 weeks and I never heard from them, I called. They had approved the claim but decided to review it again and decided to file it under my hail and wind which is a joke. That deductible is 7,000+ dollars. I find it interesting they approved it under what the adjuster suggested but I suspect they didn't want to pay out so, they decided well let us file it under wind and hail. A second look after it was approved the first time!!! They never sent out a second adjuster for a second opinion just people sitting behind a desk. This is unacceptable. I guess they wanted to save that 3,000+.",742

I did comparison and cancelled my auto and went to Geico where I have ALL of the same features and my monthly payments are only $176.00 a month.

Our homeowners' insurance rebuild cost has been $680,000 for the last several years. This year when our renewal policy arrived, we received a letter from USAA telling us they were now using Xactware to estimate rebuild cost, and based on their program, our rebuild cost would be $486,000. Our building is continuing to build in our community and homes like ours are selling in the high $800,000 to $900,000 so we know that our home cannot be duplicated for less than $680,000. We asked USAA to show us an explanation for our prior rebuild cost and their new estimated rebuild cost so they sent a representative from a company, Mueller, to look at our home, take photos and provide them a report.  Based on the Mueller report, they revised their estimated rebuild cost to $536,000. We called again after receiving the most recent rebuild estimate and again asked for an explanation. The representative we talked with, Alex, was most polite and professional and explained USAA estimates are based on the average cost of rebuilding in our community using their Xactware Software program and they would choose the person or company to rebuild our home in the event of a catastrophic event. We would not be able to choose our former builder to replicate our home. This was brand new information to us and we have not yet determined whether other insurance companies have the same protocol - Using a software program to estimate cost and choosing the building rather than allowing the homeowner to choose the building.  But we certainly found this information unsettling in view of our annual cost of over $2000 for our homeowners' policy and the escalating USAA homeowners insurance cost we have encountered in recent years. After over 40 years with USAA, we have gathered our declarations pages from all of our insurance coverage currently provided by USAA and sending them for quotes from other insurance companies. If you have homeowners' coverage with USAA, I would encourage to inquire about the details - How they estimate coverage and whether you or USAA would choose your new building in the event of a catastrophic event.  It makes me sad to write this review as, in past years, we have had excellent service from USAA. I would advise others to shop before choosing USAA. The customer service has definitely declined in the last 5 to 8 years.

No instead they took 3 hours and came back with the determination that the fraud was enabled by my son or I somehow. The withdrawals happened in GA, we live in AZ.

They also informed me that because they had decided to not repair my Jeep, the rental car must be returned immediately.

I don’t know how USAA treats its own clients, but they did not treat me well. After my car was totaled, USAA only allowed 3 days of rental.

Then the total loss adjuster called and insisted that I should send in my car title even before I could read the settlement offer and terms. When asked if sending in title constitutes an agreement to the settlement, they did not wish to answer the question.  After I read the offer, I did not wish to take it. Upon repeat requests, they finally told me sending in the title indicates my agreement to the settlement offer. This is a deceptive practice. In valuing of the loss vehicle, they were not fair in assessing the condition of the vehicle. They made every effort to under-state the condition of vehicle (e.g., mechanics).

USAA was quick to send out a mitigation company, however the company they sent did not do a good job. By the end of May we had some new smells in our home. At first USAA directed us to resolve the issue with the contractor they sent. The contractor came at the beginning of June told us they needed USAA's approval but would get back to us. By July we hired a contractor to assist us and USAA required a report from them to authorize looking for mold. Mold was found and USAA required an additional leak test in order to cover the mold claiming it could not have been from the original claim. The test came back showing we had no leaks and we finally had authorization to remove the mold from the home. The entire time that mold was being worked on I was told my family had to live in the home despite having the loss of use clause in my policy. By the end of August it was clear that the mold was extensive and impacted all restrooms. At this point we moved out of our home. Our adjuster had still never been to the property. I had attempted to reach her supervisor but she was the acting supervisor for over a two week period. USAA would not give me a number to anyone other that the adjuster and their supervisor. My requests for a new adjuster were also denied. Finally at the end of September our adjuster showed up. Met with me, the contractor and our abatement company representative. We had a full quote for her a few days after the meeting as was requested. However, our adjuster took a vacation after the meeting prior to completing her work. The individual she said would continue work on the claim was not available and her supervisor is not an adjuster and was unable to pick up the work. When she arrived back on October 20th she sent an email which stated she was waiting for information. I called to ask what she needed and she told me nothing that she just had to finish processing her estimate. Later that week I had to provide her all the same information that was provided 4 weeks earlier. The adjuster then stated she was still waiting for a report from the abatement company despite the fact the company had provided all requested information previously. When we finally received an estimate it was unrealistic. In fact she had lowered the allotment for the floors she previously approved for the USAA preferred contractor by over $2 a square foot. Other material and labor costs did not take into account the contractors quote where he had sourced specific materials. An example of the ridiculous adjusting is that for a rebuilt kitchen in San Diego which is down to the frame (without appliances) they offered just over $9K. I have not been able to find any contractor to meet the pricing. Furthermore USAA uses a adjusting program that provides average costs yet it does not offer standard deviations. After calling the company that makes the program it is clear their material cost methodology is rather strong (but doesn’t always factor well for waste based on patching etc. ); however their labor cost methodology is not actually based on real jobs or actual work orders for an area. USAA advised me. I had been paid enough to get me back in my home even though the check required mortgage company endorsement. My mortgage company will not endorsed without a signed contract covering the scope of the payment. My adjuster told me that is an issue with the mortgage company. Here I am without additional approval for alternative housing beyond the end of the month and no way to get back in my home. The last correspondence from the adjuster stated that she needed per sq. ft. or linear foot quotes for labor from the quote received 8 weeks prior rather than per job numbers. My contractor explained that my adjuster has required more than any other adjuster they have worked with. My adjuster also mentioned in her last correspondence that if I want to get a lawyer to let her know. I shouldn’t need to hire a lawyer to deal with my insurance company and me and my kids should not be homeless for the holidays because USAA is not paying for us to be out of our home and we have the coverage.",779

However, after talking with 3 senior officials USAA made no changes to the quote. I found out later that because I had been such a long term customer they actually had raised my rates over the years under the mindset that I would not leave their services. Experts in the insurance agency cautions people not to do what I did to avoid being classified as such. The longer you remain a customer the greater likelihood your rates will not be competitive. Seek new rates every 3 years, insurance companies track your history and only offer the best rates to customers that shop around. My new insurance company is Amica they are rated equal to USAA or higher depending on where you look. My rates were $2200 a year cheaper with equivalent policy coverage.

I dropped the car off, got my rental car and waited for the car to be fixed.  Now it's 5 days later and this morning, I get a surprise deposit in my bank account from USAA for $1,200. No explanation. No phone call. Nothing. Just $1,200. So I call them and they tell me that the money is for the damage to my car. They tell me that I can do what I want with the money. I can get my car fixed or just keep the money, either way. Well, thanks a lot, USAA. Since newbie Eric told me that I HAD to get the car fixed, now I'm forced to spend that $1,200 on my car whether I want to or not. The damage was just cosmetic, not mechanical at all. So I would NOT have gotten it fixed if I had known I had a choice. But Eric didn't explain ANYTHING to me about the claims process. He said nothing about a deposit. He said nothing about not having to get the car fixed. Absolutely nothing.  When I called to try and fix this, the woman, Shelley, just kept telling me that it wasn't her fault that there was a mistake made. I said, ""Yes, I understand that. But it WAS your company's fault."" The people I dealt with were incredibly rude and not helpful at all. I was transferred to 4 different ""specialists"" before someone actually knew what they were talking about. I can say for sure that I will be switching insurance companies. USAA has really gone downhill lately. Not helpful at all anymore.",790

Over the time I have been with USAA I have had multiple accounts including Checking, Savings, Retirement, Auto and Renters Insurance, Auto Loans and Personal Loans. Additionally I am a legacy. All my family have been customers. My parents always told me that USAA was exceptional but I have had enough. I have recently graduated from law school and while in the process of earning my degree, and on a VERY tight budget. My little part time employer repeatedly guaranteed that my weekly paycheck would be auto deposited and when it continually wouldn't I had a few ACH payments bounce. As soon as I noticed what happened I called USAA and they would waive the overdraft payment and I would manually deposit my check within a day or two. I accept responsibility for what had happened but was doing the best I possibly could. So now that I am back on my feet I thought all of this stress was behind me. However, I was very wrong! I made a deposit with my USAA app on my phone. The balance reflected their entire $2000 as available. However this was WRONG! I was hours from home trying to use my debit card but it was declined. I phoned USAA and was told that I have a hold on the deposit for 7 business days. I was finally connected with a manager who told me that because I had carried low weekly balances and had payments overdraft that I was not able to access my deposit for 7 business days (which actually was 8 full business days). I was basically chastised. When I told the manager that I was hours from home without access to my deposit he offered to connect me to the credit card department so that I could take a cash advance! I was livid. I called back later that evening when I got home hoping that the jerky manager was a fluke and that someone else would certainly be able to help me out. Instead I was shocked when I was lectured and offered help learning how to manage my finances! I again explained that the app didn't tell me that I had a hold and was told that after I uploaded my deposit I should have logged onto the USAA website to know that I had a hold. Again, difficult when you have no idea that is even an issue. To that I was told that I should have read my user agreement that I apparently signed 17 years ago. In short, I used to use USAA because they had great customer service and an advanced app. Now that even small town banks have the same mobile banking, I won't be staying on as a customer. An 8 business day hold on a check is simply absurd but not even telling members that this is an issue and instead showing a balance as if the full deposit is there is unacceptable and can really leave people in bad situations.

I answered a call from Jake, a USAA representative on or around November 4. He called inquiring about our October payment. I replied that we certainly did not dispute the debt owed, and questioned whether or not there were options available for my husband and me to delay payment. Jake volunteered information on USAA's deferment program. Specifically, he said if I was able to pay the October arrearage, I could then call back and request a 2-month deferment. I asked him if this was a program we had to qualify for. He replied, ""No. After your payment clears, just call us back and ask to be transferred to an agent who can assist you with deferment.""  I again confirmed the amount due. I asked if that included late charges. Jake replied, ""No, you do not have to pay the late charges right now,"" and that all I had to do was confirm the date I would pay so he could document it in his notes. I made the payment online when promised which is now four days ago. I have confirmation of the payment being received. So, I called today to ask for the deferment. After waiting on hold for 30 minutes I was now told by Diane that we do not qualify because (1) we needed to pay the outstanding late charges, and (2) we don't qualify anyway because of the state we live in. This information was never disclosed to us by Jake even though he took it upon himself to share the deferment option with us and he had our full history in front of him, including the state where we reside. I asked for a supervisor. Diane said she would transfer me and the phone line promptly went dead.  I called back again, was put on hold again, and ultimately Jake answered the phone. After confirming my name security information, I asked him if he remembered me from about 10 days ago. Initially, he replied, ""Yes."" When I repeated back notes I took during our conversation, he backpedaled and said something like he talks to so many people and can't be sure it was me. He also denied having any conversation with me about deferment even when I again recited the date, time, and details of our conversation. Curiously, although he denied our conversation, he was reading notes on his computer from that very conversation. So how in the world is he going to deny talking to me when he took those notes? I asked Jake to transfer me to Diane. Another agent named James picked up. I asked for Diane. James replied that ""Diane sits right next to me"" but he couldn't tell me where she was, couldn't give me her telephone extension, and didn't know when she'd be back. Without rehashing my situation all over again, I asked for the name and extension of a supervisor. James provided that information to me. I thanked him and hung up. What were the consequences?

When I say a hard illegal right turn cut off.... that's the best description I can give that will give you an idea as to how she turned with no regard to other drivers. I was in a designated turn lane, in an area where I have lived for 20+ years. I was preparing to turn when their insured (who was unfamiliar with the area, admitted to being lost and late to pick her daughter up) decided to make a sharp right turn into my designated turn lane. She then refused to pull over and to get her to do so I had to stop in front of her and call the police. Suddenly then she agreed to pull over only when threatened with the police. We never had an actual collision due to my quick thinking and reflexes.  Had I hit her, there would have most likely been many thousands of dollars in damage to both her vehicle and mine not to mention possible bodily injury. Instead I quickly hit the brake and also pulled on the emergency brake to stop on a dime and avoid hitting her rear passenger door of her Yukon Denali (not the back end, because she jerked into my lane as if she was turning sharp right and not just veering into my lane as a courteous and aware driver does when changing lanes.) The result of me hitting the brakes so hard caused a can of oil based paint that was secured in my front passenger seat with the seatbelt to be expelled from the seat and the lid to be jarred so that the blue paint flooded my floor board and door panels and spots of the paint also landed on the seat and a wool coat I had.  When USAA insured finally pulled over, she immediately came to my car and looked at the damage and stated the following: ""I am so sorry, I did not see you in traffic. I was lost and running late to pick up my daughter. I will happily pay for the damage to your car since it was my fault this happened."" She finally gave me her insurance information and phone number right before the police showed up. I approached the officer and told him that just prior to him showing up that she had agreed to cover the damages and he walked over to my car with me to see the damages for himself stating that he had never encountered a call such as this.  During conversation between the 3 of us and as I was doing my best to secure the excess spilled paint and remove the bucket and soaked floor mats she again stated in the presence of the sworn officer that the incident was all her fault due to her negligence and that she would pay for all of the damages done to my car as a result of the incident. She asked where my mats were purchased from because the passenger mat had to be discarded. She also asked me to quickly get an estimate so that I could let her know the cost of repairs. If the cost was too high she would just use her USAA policy to cover it so she didn't have to pay out of her own pocket but she preferred to not have to file a claim at all.  I IMMEDIATELY went to the dealer to see if either the damage could be cleaned and salvaged or if it needed to be replace due to the culprit being an oil base paint. The estimate I received was somewhere around $2,600. (I don't have it in front of me as I type this to give an exact figure here). She immediately decided to use her USAA policy to handle the charges. Well the very next morning I informed my insurance provider of the incident just so it was documented and let her know via text. A few hours later she responded with a claim number from her USAA policy. Within just a few hours USAA called me and told me the claim was denied because there was not an actual collision.  Apparently the fact that she openly admitted fault and openly offered to pay for my damages due to her own negligence did not matter at all. Even though my quick response potentially saved USAA thousands upon thousands of dollars in damages by avoiding a collision as I did, they still feel the need to ""stick it to me"". I am a nursing student. I work FT while in school FT and still survive pay check to pay check. My insurance company will cover this under my comprehensive policy but I am still responsible for the deductible and I do not feel it is fair that my provider pay anything when this entire incident was due to USAA's irresponsible driver and she had taken full responsibility for it multiple times.  She lied to her provider stating the paint was not secured when it was. No telling what else she told them but none of what she said f verifiable by the police officer and my statement is. So the lesson here is next time someone nearly crashes into me or next time I am in a near catastrophic accident (even if my quick actions and competent driving skills can avoid it) is to allow the other driver to crash into me and risk my life and theirs and cost the other driver's insurance provider lots of monetary damages. Because if I avoid a major collision but something weird and unexpected like this should ever happen again I will be the one getting screwed over. This woman Laurie is not being held accountable at all for her terrible lack of driving skills. She is not having to fork up one damn penny for something that was solely her fault and USAA is right there with her patting her on the back for getting away with it. While I sit here struggling to find a way to pay a deductible that I should not be having to pay and my insurance is stuck paying more than $2K for something the driver and/or her own provider should be paying for. USAA (and this driver) are despicable. Their actions and denial to do what is right and proper is disgusting. Neither this lady or USAA has any integrity whatsoever. Beware using them and BEWARE EVEN MORE if you are ever in a situation that involves one of their drivers because there is a good chance you will be taken to the cleaners.",813

I have spent over $2,200.00 on the car over the last 9 months! The engine light is still on! So, the 08 Accord will not pass the next inspection!  I received $9,000 from USAA and the KBB for my car is $10,926. So, I could not replace the car for a car similar to my 2010 Honda Civic. I ended up with a 2008 Honda Accord instead for $8,300... 2010: Interior in excellent condition. Engine - it had a brand new engine. Miles - 88,000. 2008: Interior in poor condition and has over 50 cigar burn marks on the carpets and seats. The engine in poor condition and the engine light is still on I have spent 2,200 so far over the last 9 months. Exterior wrecked on the right side. Miles - 125,000. I had car rental on my policy. So, I rented from Enterprise. After 30 days, the claim process was still not complete. Enterprise made a call to my father because they had not received a payment. My father was outraged at how USAA / Enterprise handled this situation. My father said, ""Have you tried calling USAA for a payment instead of me?!"" USAA immediately made a payment for the first 30 day period. I was so mad! I immediately called USAA to find out what the problem was. USAA told me they only make 1 payment to the rental company when the claim is complete. Enterprise said all other insurance companies pay every 2 or 3 week intervals!! I was in the rental for 31 days! The claim was opened 4/17/14 and closed 10/17/14. I spoke with an associate from USAA about extending the rental. She put in a request for this. I asked her if corporate executives usually approve the rental extensions and she told me, ""Yes!"" So, I stayed in the car rental based on her information. However, it took over 2 weeks for the corporate executives determined that the extension was not approved. So, I paid over $500.00 to Enterprise for the days the rental was not approved by USAA. This allowed me no time to search for a replacement car!! The 2010 Honda Civic was my only means of transportation. My income is also on the low end. So, I had to continue my search with no car! I walked to Overseas Car Care one morning. I talked with a front desk associate about my situation with USAA. She told me a loaner car would be provided if you are purchasing a used car. So, I drove their car for 3 weeks until I found a used car. I purchased a used a car from Overseas Car Care on 6/7/14. I have already filed a complaint against Overseas Car Care 2/28/15. I purchased a used a car from Overseas Car Care on 6/7/14. I had asked Rick, one of the owners, to locate a used Honda Civic or Accord -- a car which had not been smoked in because I have allergies to cigarette smoke! I had wanted to see the car before purchasing it. However, the car was in Fort Worth. Rick said that he would inspect the car for me to make sure it was ok. However, he did not inspect the car before driving it back to Dallas. The car had multiple burn marks all over the leather seats and carpet which indicated that it had been smoked in. The Honda Accord was also wrecked, had no inspection sticker, no Texas registration tags, no Texas plates, and the engine light was on! The Accord had been in a garage for over 2 years with no one driving the car! I spent $2,214.00 in repairs to get the car ready to be safe and ready for the road! The Accord was a disaster! I had paid $8,300.00 cash to Rick of Overseas Car Care for the 08 Honda Accord! I could not understand how he even claimed to inspect the car and drive it over from Fort Worth when the car was a complete disaster! He told me that there was nothing he could do about the car and that I had already paid for the car. I was livid because he had promised me that he would not accept the car if it had been smoked in! Rick claimed that once the money is paid to the auctioneer there is no way the auctioneer will take the car back! He was lying when he told me that he would inspect the car and refuse the car before driving the car back! I met with Rick and his brother on separate visits about giving me a refund or buying the car back from me. Rick and his brother Tony each said no to my requests! As of 2/28/14, I did not receive any compensation for any expenses on the car or satisfaction regarding returning the car and getting my money back. USAA took too long to process the claim 10/17/14. I received $11,053.28 from USAA on 6/4/14. I would also like to be reimbursed for the difference between the FMV $12,222.72 and what I was paid $11,053.28 is $1,222.72.

I called them this morning to have the repairs taken care of and was assisted by a nice and informative rep. He walked me through the process and said he would take care of setting everything up. A couple hours later, a body shop called me and tried to set up an appointment to get the car inspected and create an estimate for the insurance company. They are only available Monday to Friday, 9-3. I explained that I have to work at that time and asked if they can do it on the weekends, but they said no. I remembered that the rep at USAA told me they had several locations to choose from, so I told her I would call them back and find somewhere that had different hours.  I called USAA and spoke to a woman who was rude and short with me. I explained that this accident was not my fault and that I cannot miss work to get an estimate on the repairs. She called one place while I was on the phone and they were open until 4. I told her I get out of work at 5:30 and might be able to leave a little early, but not over an hour. She said ""Well what do you want me to do about that,"" which is not good customer service at all. I finally asked if I can take some time to call shops and set up an appointment myself. I find it very hard to believe that no one is open after mid-afternoon to stop by and just do a quick inspection so the insurance company can have an estimate. I have never considered using USAA, but I would definitely never recommend that anyone work with them. I'm stuck because the person who hit me has them, and they are making this so much harder than it needs to be. This was just a small accident, but I can only imagine how they treat people when there is real damage or injuries.",815

We have purchased several of their products to include multiple car insurance, renters & homeowners insurance, and vehicle financing. So we were shocked when we received a USAA check in the mail for the payment we had just made for six month automobile coverage starting Jan 09-July 09. We made a pre-payment in June 2008 for 6 months of coverage and simply lost track of time. We were 11 days behind the due date for our current policy at the time of payment; again pre-paying for 6 months of coverage. Unbeknownst to us, USAA had already decided to cancel our car insurance outright as of the 9th. We were later told that the customer service rep should not have taken our payment. We called USAA immediately after we received the check back. We were told that there was nothing they could do and they did not want our business anymore because of payment history. We have only filed one claim ever with them when the wind swung my door into the door of a neighboring car. We asked them if they ever tried calling us to remind us about our account or that the first payment was coming due and they said there was one automated try. Either they have way too many customers or they believe they are recession-proof. To turn away paying customers who pay for six months of coverage in advance is just not good business sense and defies logic. To top it off, we asked to be transferred to the finance department so we can find out the remaining balance for our existing car so we can get it financed elsewhere. They acted baffled and confused when we told them since they did not want us as a customer for their insurance products, we were not going to remain a customer to them at all. Then they had the nerve to say thank you for trusting USAA to which we retorted well we don't anymore.

When I got home I had neck pains and my head hurt and my vision was a little blurry. I called USAA to see what I needed to do as far as medical attention but all I got were voicemails. I proceeded to go the the hospital and was diagnosed with a mild concussion. On Monday the 22nd, I took the day off of work to take car of anything with the car. I called Amber and was told I was being transfered to another adjuster, Bill Newton, and that I needed to call the body shop and rental place and set up times for my car. Bill Newton called me shortly after and told me he was sending paperwork for me to fill out and send back to him and he took some statements of what happend and the call was over. It was a week before I ever recieved his papers. I filled them out, sent them back and he confirmed they had been recieved on the 14th of February and gone to process. These forms were for my pain and suffering, wage loss from work and diminish vehicle value. As of today, the 27th, I have not heard a single word about any settlements yet.

I feel my treatment is unfair, I do not understand why it is so hard to get any answers or return calls from them. I do not understand why the other two drivers in the accident (both the at fault and the other one hit) had their body shop appointments set up on the side of the road after the accident yet I had to wait till Monday to know anything and I had to call and set up my times for the car.

Then someone broke into my truck. They stole my stereo system (that I didn't expect to be covered) and I was left with a broken windshield. All I wanted to claim was the windshield. They told me that it wasn't covered. So I called and they said the system was down or something so they couldn't see anything in my profile but the guy told me that storage insurance should cover anything that happened while it was stored no matter what happened because it was like full coverage but only covered what would have happened in storage; if I took it out before changing status it wouldn't cover anything. So he filed a new claim for me and assured me it would be covered.  Well the next day I got a call saying that it would not be covered because when they put storage insurance on it, It was essentially liability only. I was told, ""If a kid is jumping off the back of your truck and breaks his leg you are insured"". I got pissed off because I was storing my truck at my house and that is what my home owner's insurance is there to cover... So I pulled my cars off of USAA and went to another provider. However I left my camper on USAA. I had full coverage on my camper because I had a loan out on it. Well a big storm ripped through. We had 60+mph winds and 18 inches of rain in about 24 hours. It tore the camper apart. The roof was damaged and it flooded the inside ruining everything. I had the camper less than a year and it was in like new condition when I got it. I had used it all summer and never had an issue with it. My wife and I loved the camper.  Well now the roof was half ripped off from the wind, the inside had been ruined, the cheap particle board on the walls and ceilings was falling apart because it was so wet, water damage everywhere. The adjuster came out from who knows where and said that he doesn't think a storm could do that to a camper because where he was they just got a few light thunderstorms that day but nothing bad. I had before and after pictures and tried everything. They just refused to pay. So I was stuck with a totaled camper with a loan on it. I don't have the money to get a lawyer and fight it so I sold the camper for scrap and paid off a loan on something I didn't have anymore because I got royally bent over by a company claiming to be there for the vets.

I retired outside the US. My debit and credit cards have been falsely flagged for fraudulent activity at least half a dozen times in the last few years. Each time I have been traveling outside my home country. Despite notifying USAA in advance of the dates and locations of my travel, despite the fact that many of the fraudulent flag notices came while shopping at military facilities in Italy, my cards continue to be flagged. One would think that if the mechanism used is routinely erroneously flagging cards as fraudulent, tweaking the mechanism would be warranted. There does not seem to be any awareness of the problems this causes the customer or any concern about improving their security procedures. The latter are important but if they become too burdensome you may be compelled to look elsewhere for your banking services.  In addition I started requesting replacement cards several months ago for my MC which expires in two days. Cards were sent to a PO box I visit infrequently. In early June, I requested they sent the cards to my home address, expecting, as they have in the past they would be expedited mail. This is necessary because the regular mail system is unreliable. Mid-month I discovered the cards had been sent regular mail, contacted USAA and was informed they would resend via FedEx.  A week later, with no cards in hand, I contacted USAA again and found out the cards had again been sent regular mail. My cards expire tomorrow, the day after I am leaving on a nine day trip. Because of the problem of false fraudulent flagging of my cards it would be more than useful to have access to both my debit cards and my MC. I have spent much time online with USAA and on the phone. The international phone bills come at my expense. Occasionally they offer reimbursement but it is not routine.  When I travel now I have to take special precautions and consider how I will pay my expenses if my cards are blocked. USAA has become a headache when I travel. Now with their inability to get my replacement cards to me on time and their response to this failure make it clear that I need to be using another financial institution. My discussions with them indicated some staff who were trying to be helpful, some that were misrepresenting the facts, and some who were completely clueless.  The higher up the chain I went the less interest there was at the problems of the customer and much more interest in defending their policies, procedures, and personnel, even when it was clear they made mistakes or have procedures that need to be relooked.

I have enjoyed my experience for the most part, with the exception of some instances where they held larger checks for unreasonable amounts of time, but I've found this to be true of most banks. My auto insurance, though a bit high, has been flawless. I've made several roadside assistance claims and a few claims for fender benders, and I've never had to wait more than 24 hours for insurance payments. Roadside assistance has bailed me out of several ""oops I locked my keys in my car"" situations. I've never had to file a claim on my renter's insurance, so I can't really speak to that. They reimburse ATM fees and give customers a refund at the end of each year based on the amount they earn above what they need to cover expenses, so that's a great perk.  Recently, I applied for a VA backed mortgage loan and got pre-qualified immediately. I gave them accurate information, though I realized my credit was low and I would be starting a new job soon, both things that would make the process more difficult and things that had discouraged me from applying in the past. They acted as if it was no big deal and even gave me a higher loan pre-approval based on my new salary. My originator and processor were friendly and responsive, but two days before my closing date, my loan was denied because my credit was too low, I didn't have enough time with my current employer, and I didn't have enough liquid assets - (I made sure I had what my originator told me I would need). There was never any mention of a need for more assets above what I would need for closing.  I realize it's the underwriters who make the final decision, but I'm confident there is some common knowledge in the department about what will and will not fly for this company, and I was led to believe there wouldn't be any problems getting the loan and then had the rug pulled out from under me right before closing. Additionally, since homeowner's insurance was required to complete the application and I was loyal to the company, I went ahead and got it with USAA. The premium was absolutely ridiculous, but being a first time home buyer, I didn't realize that until I was advised by another lender to shop around. I've since found comparable insurance for less than half of USAA's premium. To summarize, banking, auto and renter's insurance are great.

However, USAA made the arrangements for me to pick up the rental car on Thursday 9-1-11. The representative knew the only reason for doing this on a Thursday was because the next day I had off work. USAA documented that I was made aware of their policy, but I never heard about the ""No Thursday drop-off"" policy until 9-13-11 when Enterprise called demanding the out-of-pocket payment for days not covered by USAA because the rental began on a Thursday. When the USAA claims adjuster issued an estimate for my vehicle repairs, they estimated 7 days. The repairs were not done until 11 days. The repairs started on the same day I dropped off the car, Thursday. The first few times I called USAA regarding this issue, they said that if the body shop submitted some paperwork requesting a supplement, the extra days should be covered and my problem should be resolved. I called the body shop and they complied with my request to file for a supplement. According to my insurance company (Shelter), the body shop was paid for the extra days, but Enterprise was not. I paid the balance, $125.54 because Enterprise was going to report it to the credit bureaus and I'm currently in the market for a house. I cannot afford any blemishes on my credit. I had an extremely difficult time in getting any answers to my questions. I often had to have a representative ""put a note on the account"" for a manager to call me the next day and very rarely would I actually receive a call. 9-30-11: I spoke with a manager by the name of Debbie **. She finally told me that the reason USAA would not cover the days was because I dropped off my vehicle at the body shop and picked up the rental car at Enterprise on a Thursday and according to their documentation, I was made aware of the ""No Thursday drop-off"" policy. My sentiment about the whole situation is this: My car was damaged through no fault of my own. I made a claim against the other party's insurance and the repairs took longer than expected, also through no fault of my own. I feel that USAA should not even arrange for a Thursday pickup of a rental car if they have a policy against paying for it.

It seemed so easy, put all rental homes, personal residence, life insurance, umbrella insurance, 3 cars (I'm I forgetting anything) under one ""roof"". Yeah easy. YEAH EXPENSIVE!!! In 2010 my son's beloved 2 year old Subaru was stolen from student housing. After 4 days it was found, bashed, books and some contents stolen. USAA towed it to Subaru for estimates. They came back $8900 worth of damage.  It took 3 weeks for USAA to 'determine' the car had NOT been stolen, but that it was a story my son (a pre-med student at UCSD at the time) had concocted. NOT A CENT was paid to me. I got an attorney who said it was very common. That there was no reason to fight it because USAA had attorneys on salary who would send letters, ask for depositions, make phone calls and basically ring up $10K worth of atty bills so it just wasn't worth my time. I swore I'd move the insurance, but jeez there's so much to move and recalculate and all the sq footage, make model, year etc. I didn't do it. Well one month ago my truck was stolen after insuring it 11 years with USAA. Gone. I HATE dealing with them. Only when I call to change insurance do I get a person, claims go straight to someone's phone machine. They don't talk to you, they send you 'message alerts' which aren't always convenient to get and I don't trust that system. The messages have been rude, condescending (here's one when I asked what about the stuff inside the truck: ""you have already reported there was nothing of value inside the vehicle"" working FOR me? You better not believe it!), and confusing. Forget about talking to a real person. It has been a complete nightmare. First they refuse to reimburse me for equipment I can't PROVE I had, which was on the truck when I started insuring it 11 years ago. They want actual receipts! Who has that? I didn't get all those from the owner. But I do have some photos although they have said they aren't acceptable. I'm pretty sure they can be made to accept them as proof... ""GO PHOTO YOUR CAR RIGHT NOW!! All 4 sides and inside!!"" They told me the side shots (of running boards) weren't acceptable because it couldn't be proven it was MY truck. Honestly, with the same camper on it in all the photos? They use ""comps"" not a formula like Kelley's. USAA used to have their own 'blue book' but no longer. I had a diesel long bed, their comps gas short beds. How do they determine the value of the lack of that equipment/trim? I cannot even find a diesel long bed for sale in US that has less than 100K miles without being 5yrs new. So they use comps that have 300K miles and comps that have 12K miles. I thought I was insuring for REPLACEMENT. The equipment will not be replaced. I can't even find a truck to replace it with! There is no help with that. AND BE AWARE that if you have contents, especially in a big ole truck, that is a separate claim with a separate deductible. UGG. Contents go to home insurance, which my deductible was $5000 because I was thinking hmmm--fire? Flood? Hurricane? I did not even consider if my vehicle was STOLEN which I have no control over, that contents would be considered a HOME peril. Just furious and with myself for not switching. A friend told me he became fed up with insurance about 10 years ago, put his property and cars on the minimum amount required by law and then an umbrella policy. Didn't even insure his paid for house... and he figures by now he's saved enough to buy 2 new cars with NO claim hassles. That is advice I'm taking. If everyone quit paying for insurance that actually only covers about 1/2 what they think they are paying for? I guess insurance companies wouldn't be houses in the tallest skyscrapers in every city. What a scam. Prior to USAA I've used GEICO and Allstate, I'm going back. I thought USAA was a non-profit, actually they're to help the military...

We immediately called a plumber and had the leak repaired; however, they found mold damage that required $12,000 worth of repairs. After sending an adjuster to the unit, he said in his opinion the leak had been going on for over two weeks so they were not required to pay the claim. He said the renters should have noticed it. The renters did not see the leak or the mold, which was well beneath their under the sink cleaning supplies.  I called the adjuster to plead my case. I explained I was 8 months pregnant and unable to fly, and that my husband was currently deployed so it was impossible for us to attend to this in person. I explained that in fact there was a small leak that had been repaired previously that could have caused the warped cabinetry, that he claimed was the telltale sign of damage. While he admitted this was new information, he said he would not resubmit his findings to USAA because it would damage his credibility. I told him while that was all well and good, this bill was going to cause us to lose our home, file for bankruptcy and result in my husband's security clearance getting pulled and us being kicked out of the military.  I am absolutely disgusted to think his credibility as an adjuster trumps the well-being of a family with a deployed spouse. How could a company that claims to be there for military families be so arbitrary and well, greedy?

My 8-year-old daughter was hit by our next door neighbor while riding her scooter on the sidewalk. The driver backed up and did not see my daughter and hit her. She had a bruised thigh as well as a sprained knee. The driver is insured by USAA. USAA is claiming that because of the bush (on the driver’s property), it is considered a blind spot which is reason for them not taking full responsibility for hitting my daughter. They are also claiming that it is a supervision issue since I allowed my daughter, who is 8 years old, to ride her scooter outside without supervision.  We are talking about next door to our home. She is allowed to ride 2 houses up from our house and 2 houses down from our house, nothing further. She was not alone; she was playing outside with her brother. My husband and I leave the garage door up and house garage door open so that we can hear them and peak outside to see them. One last note, we live in a very safe neighborhood with lots of children playing outside on almost a daily basis. So due to these two reasons, the insurance is stating that my daughter is partially to blame (60/40). I refused to allow this and the insurance will not take full responsibility. After arguing on the phone and speaking to a supervisor, USAA stated they would be comfortable going to 80/20. CALIFORNIA LAW - Pedestrian Right of Way Laws: California Vehicle Code Section 21949-21971 pedestrian right of way laws states: The driver of a vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to a pedestrian crossing the roadway within any marked crosswalk or within any unmarked crosswalk at an intersection, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. More so the code state that a driver shall, exercise all due care and shall reduce the speed of the vehicle or take any other action relating to the operation of the vehicle as necessary to safeguard the safety of the pedestrian. 21952. The driver of any motor vehicle, prior to driving over or upon any sidewalk, shall yield the right-of-way to any pedestrian approaching thereon. Also another known fact would be to keep the landscape trimmed to avoid unnecessary hazards. If you are in a driveway or parking lot with a lot of shrubs, make it a point to double check blind spots and mirrors. I believe USAA does not want to take responsibility not due to these reasons, but due to payout. Honestly, I find that this is **. I will say that I highly doubt that our small town and our judge would rule that my daughter was anything other than an innocent pedestrian/child. I also would bet the judge would find the neighbor at 100% fault. After all, these overgrown shrubs are on the neighbor’s property. It is her duty to be more cautious when driving out of her driveway. FURTHERMORE, the police report states that the driver is at fault.",864

USAA took my claim and then essentially disappeared. I was told they had accepted the estimate/liability, so I had the repairs done, only to find they were accepting 50/50 liability. According to my collision center, USAA had been ""trying to call [me] for days,"" and needed some additional information; I had no missed calls on my work or cell phone and no voicemail messages. I called USAA (this is 9 days later, at this point, which is how long it took for me to get in touch with them) and they reported ""We still need to take your recorded statement,"" once they did that (again - 9 days later, when my memory was no longer fresh), they said it conflicted with that of the insured and they would need to get pictures of the insured's damage to determine final liability. A day later my collision center says they have spoken with USAA and USAA has accepted final liability of 50/50 - the collision center stressed to me that they asked several times to make sure it was actually FINALIZED. I call USAA and they report to me it is NOT FINALIZED and they are still waiting on pictures from the insured. Several days later, my Geico representative calls to tell me USAA has finalized at 50/50, so I call and ONCE AGAIN they tell me that the liability has NOT been finalized. At this point, I still don't have my car, and it has been 2-weeks since the accident (going on 3). Every time I speak with USAA I get a different response. I still have NOT spoken with the actual claims adjuster (who never saw either vehicle in person) despite having left her multiple messages. My collision center has also left her multiple messages and been unable to reach her. I have yet to receive a SINGLE CALL from USAA in the last two weeks, despite their claims to the contrary. At this point, I'm pretty sure they are just hoping I'll go pay 100% so I can get my car back and then they can back out and say 50/50 or 0/100 liability, in which case I'm screwed and have already paid so have 0 leverage.

This type of irresponsibility flies in the face of the State of California's Compulsory Financial Responsibility Law.  It resulted in me having to enter into litigation to enforce the law and recover my losses. Ultimately, I was paid by court order, however, not after nearly six months of waiting, having to take time off to prepare and appear in court, and being without a vehicle for the duration. Any prospective customers of USAA automobile insurance company should be aware that this type of stance means that you are going to have to be prepared to take time off of work, enter into a court environment to protect yourself from liability based on USAA's automatic determination of their 75% responsibility regardless of the facts, and become unfriendly towards anyone who seeks to indemnify themselves from material losses incurred from a traffic collision caused by you. You'd better be absolutely certain that you never get into an accident where a police officer or judge determines that you are at 100% fault for an accident, otherwise, be prepared to take time to face the judgement.  USAA needs to become a financially-responsible company, and held 100% liable and financially responsible for their clients.

On 8 August, I activated the water supply to the residence and that afternoon, an H2O (water company) employee arrived to turn on the water to the house. On 17 August 2011 at 8:24am, I was contacted by H2O with an urgent message that said my home was reported by a neighbor as having water cascading continuously from the second floor of the residence. I informed them I was still living in Tacoma, Washington and that I needed them to turn off the source of water to the residence and they immediately complied. On 17 August, I purchased plane tickets for a close friend who traveled to the newly purchased residence to inspect the damage, report the loss to my insurance carrier (USAA) and report back what had happened. On 17 August 2011 at 11:57pm, my friend arrived at the residence. On 18 August, I contacted USAA who assigned the case an adjuster known only to us as Mike **. In five days, Mike never once contacted us, responded to any messages left for him nor was available in any way and in fact, I still have never had any contact with that agent. On 18 August, USAA dispatched Steamatic out of Tempe, Arizona to begin clean up operations to the residence. On 19 August, I packed a 20-foot U-Haul with all our possessions and began the drive to my new residence in Arizona. On 20 August 2011 at 10:16pm, I arrived at the residence late at night and immediately inspected the damage to the residence. The entire floor to the master bedroom, closet and bathroom was removed. The walls up to about six inches were removed in those same areas. Large industrial fans were running to dry out the damage. In the garage, the two-car garage door was damaged. Most of the interior drywall was removed and fine dust insulation filled the air everywhere throughout the residence.  The temperature that day was a whopping 115 degrees in the shade. We moved our belongings inside the downstairs of the residence and tried to reside there but we had no way to prepare food, no water until the 22 August, no water filtration system had yet been installed, and we could not escape the miserable heat because the home was exposed to the outside air. At one point that day, the heat from the garage door exceeded 125 degrees in the garage rising and entering the house. These conditions persisted throughout most of the claim only subsiding around mid November. On 22 August, after numerous attempts to contact an agent of the insurance company, USAA, I finally contacted a person back east who promised to have a local agent call.  A person, who would only identify herself only as Terry, said she was from the non public Phoenix Office of USAA. After explaining to her the deplorable living conditions as explained above and explaining that the policy requires I get her (USAA) permission to live in a motel or other housing, I asked her if we were eligible to stay in a motel until such time as the conditions were improved. She hesitated then replied that if we could cook food and a room of the house was inhabitable then we were not eligible to stay in any other accommodations. I again repeated the conditions we were living in and added that we were coughing up our lungs, in a manner of speaking, due to a heavy layer of unsettling insulation dust floating everywhere throughout the house. She again repeated her exact same statement as above getting more and more agitated with me as I persisted. I then asked her if she thinks the living conditions I have described to her (as stated above) we are currently living in meet the criteria as inhabitable and she hesitated and then said yes. I implored her to think of what it is like to live in such conditions and she said, ""It's nothing personal."" I explained that we needed someone to begin repairs and she set up a contractor after explaining it was much easier to do things that way. On 24 August, I received a call from Crowley Construction and a request to come out to the residence and begin work right away. The next morning (25 August), I met Jim and his son, Dan, and measurements were taken and information gathered and I explained USAA needed to know the cause of the water damage. It was at this point that I began to realize that the owner, Jim **, was senile. He couldn't remember things, couldn't dial his phone correctly and was having trouble discussing general issues. Out of politeness, I said nothing but was very concerned hoping that his son was the primary party on this job. We also discussed the purchase of a new set of appliances as we were being forced to live in the house under these conditions. We were assured that we had nothing to worry about and that they would ensure our new appliances were protected. Amidst the work, we had the new appliances delivered and installed a washer dryer combo and a refrigerator. I explained to Dan ** that we were having troubles flushing toilets and that the drains were not draining properly and he said he would send out a plumber to inspect the cause.  A few days later, the plumber arrives to inspect the hot water heater. We explained the issues with poor flushing toilets and poor draining sinks and to our surprise were literally told us we needed better toilets. The workers were arriving at our residence unannounced and entering in the early hours of the day. The part of the house that was being worked on was never isolated from the rest of the house despite numerous requests and demands to by us. As a result, we were under constant debris fallout long after the workday was done. It was at this point I asked an Crowley why the workers felt as if they could do as they please in my home and he responded by telling me that they have never had people living in the home that needed this level of work before. Several additional requests to USAA to move to a more suitable living condition were denied so I requested a new adjuster be assigned the case. I was reassigned to David ** out of the Texas office. I was repeatedly told that I was not a priority and would be dealt with on occasion because there was an approaching hurricane on the south east coast and it needed their full undivided attention. At one point, I could hear shouting coming from the laundry room. As I approached, I could see and hear an employee and my ex-wife yelling at each other. As I stopped the yelling and asked what was going on, my ex-wife turned to me in tears and mumbling something, pointed to the pile of wood and debris that had dropped from the ceiling above on top of her new appliances. Crowley Construction assured me that a trained specialist would eventually be sent to inspect the appliances and it was never done. After the initial assurance that wouldn't happen fell through, I expected nothing. At one point, David ** needed to have Crowley Construction contact him so I told Jim, the owner. He was in a terrible senile moment and unable to dial the phone properly and David was short with me until I explained the situation. I was constantly having to explain what needed to be done on the job to the constant new unsupervised workers each day to the point of frustration. I demanded a solution to this with David ** (assigned adjuster) and he set up a three way call between Crowley Construction, David and myself that only ended in me shouting, ""...either put me on payroll or do your own damn job. I'm sick and tired of doing it for you!"" Nothing changed. There was a 3/4 circle about 5 feet wide in the bathroom floor. The supervisor asked if he could leave it that way and I replied no. This caused tremendous tension. A security sensor was broken off on a window. On 30 August, my ex-wife was upstairs taking a shower when suddenly a loud bang and a couple of booms startled me. A short time later, sewage and water and all manner of foul things were bursting and spewing forth from every hole in the house and a few places even in the walls. I called Crowley Construction who dispatched their plumber (same man as before). He arrived and declared there might be foul play, that sometimes people who lose their homes will sabotage a sewer line out of spite and that he would dispatch a specialist he knows to look in the line with a special camera to see what the problem might be. Not wanting to wait, I immediately went outside to the sewer access port and opened it. To my shocking amazement, out floats a red tag with the words printed in white: Property of Johnson Utilities. Do not remove under penalty of law.  I called the utility company, took pictures and notified the plumber. Jose, the utility worker, arrived at our house within minutes of my call, removed his plug (under tremendous force) in front of four witnesses and we could all hear the surge of sewage empty into the line. Damage to the downstairs of the home was extensive. That evening, the insurance company, USAA, was notified of all the circumstances. I was told it would be better to proceed by letting the insurance company pursue the utility company but not a word was mentioned of the devastating effects of filling two claims in such a short period of time. On 31 August, Steamatic of Phoenix was again dispatched to my home and conducted several days of clean up and removal. I had also decided this day that due to the poor treatment of the residents by workers, the damage to our appliances, the poor communications and the inept misinformation on the part of the plumber that got us in this mess in the first place, it was time to derail and part company with Crowley Construction.  I notified David ** who informed me he was also glad to end the ties with them and that he had an excellent company in mind called VBS whom he could get us in touch with. On one occasion, all the belongings we had were moved to the garage so painting could be done with the promise that everything would be restored. I had to restore everything without any help. No tack boards were removed throughout the home despite charging USAA for it. When I questioned it, I was scolded by a site manager. We were left to replace our own appliances and the garage was never pressure washed as bid and promised. After not having received a call from VBS Construction for over a week after they were notified by USAA of the contract, on 8 September 2011, I called Mike ** from VBS and asked him to come out to the residence to measure and write up an estimate.  Later that same day, he arrived, introduced himself and conducted his measurements. While he was doing this, I ran him through the list of mistakes made by Crowley Construction. Among the top priorities I over emphasized was care for the appliances and respect for the people residing here. He reassured me this would not be a problem and said he would email me a copy of the bid the next day and departed with his information. On 12 September after not having had any contact with VBS Construction, I called Mike ** to inquire about the bid and he stated he had been behind due to a flood of work related issues but did not go into any kind of detail. Mike then stated he would get a copy of the bid emailed to me and several days later I received it. VBS was hiring local workers, sending them out to the residence to work with little or no instructions. As a result, we were doing their job by briefing the workers on what had been accomplished and what needed to be accomplished. The workers were playing music from their large radios (boom boxes) without regard to the residents resulting in hostile attitudes and clashes.  As a result of the clashes, workers were asked not to return. At one point early on in the restoration process with VBS, a project manager was even confrontational with me. I asked Mike that he not return and a new project manager was assigned to our home restoration. Both Mike ** and Melissa ** arrived at the house a few days later apologetic offering movie tickets as an apology. The new project manager arrived upset early one morning demanding I show him what needed to be done, flipping haphazardly through the bid house plans explaining in an obvious upset voice that he now had to do his job on the other side of Phoenix and the job of the manager that just quit. Several times, we woke to workers staring in our room at us sleeping. It was uneasy and on one incident, I filed a written complaint with VBS. On October 4th, 2011, I received a call from Cody ** of Champion Garage Doors stating he would need access into my garage the next day about 7am. I explained that I was currently staying in Mesa at a motel and that I'd be certain to be there at the residence at 7am to let him install his door. On 5 October 2011 at 7am, I arrived at the residence and no one was there. I was hanging around the house when at about 9am, I received a typical call of lost workers whose bosses had never informed them where to go. I drove out to meet the workers (carpet layers) and found them in a local school parking lot and they followed me back to the house and began setting up operations to conduct their installations. It was at that moment that I realized the garage door installer had not arrived yet so I called him.  When he answered the phone, I asked him why he had not showed up at the site yet and he said in a real nasty tone that he was at a friend's house and that it was none of my business. I replied that I had waited from 7am and asked him if he had ever heard of an invention called the telephone and why he had not used it to at least let me know. With that, he became enraged, explaining his friend's garage door situation. With that, I told him he was not coming out to my house, that I would find a different company that understands common courtesy. He said **. A few minutes later, he arrived agitated and upset. He first encountered a carpet layer demanding that they move their carpet from the driveway because he had garage doors to install. As he was doing that, I cut off his conversation and explained I was the home owner and he turned and got in my face. Much taller than I, he stared down at me and asked me what my problem was. I explained that I had been here since 7am on his account and he didn't even have the decency to call when he didn't show up. He yelled something about his brother's garage door. I explained that all he needed to do was pick up the phone and then I reminded him that he is not installing his door in my house.  With that, he attempted to become intimidating, got back in my face and yelled that this is his job site. He was hired to install the door and it was going in. At that point, I explained that he needed to get off my property and he refused so I told him I was going to get a can of mace that would help him understand he needed to leave so he slowly backed off the property. He sat in his truck in front of the house for about a half hour on the phone and I was busy notifying VBS of the incident to ensure his garage door would not be installed in my home and talking to neighbors who said they were there if I needed them. On Oct 9th, I filed a complaint with the BBB over the incident. In his response dated 18 October, Mr. ** confesses, ""Jim called me right back and told me that he would figure out another way to get this job done so that another altercation would not be had. I then had another garage door installer complete the job on 10/7/11 without incident due to another project manager having to be present to keep the homeowner from attacking the other contractors.""  First, I had never attacked anyone and second Mike at VBS reassured me that they were hiring a different door company to install the door and that they told Mr. ** he was finished. Both obviously stone cold lies that I angrily confronted Mike with. At that point, he was angry with Mr. ** apparently for exposing him and I demanded the garage door be removed and soon after it was and a new one was installed with a different company some time later. I was constantly calling VBS to get things corrected like sharp wood trim pieces jetting out, improper angles that needed repair, no tack boards being removed although it was bid to have them removed, lesser quality lighting fixtures being installed, inferior carpet being installed, glue all over the floors, doors and walls all causing new managers to be assigned and more aggravation with foul attitudes.  At one point, we confronted a worker because he stood on top of our washer putting a dent in it. When I confronted Mike about it, he found it to be humorous while we did not. The refrigerator door had received a dent in the front during the flooring installation process as well and VBS was notified. The workers dumped their paint and cleaned out their brushes on our plants and all over our backyard leaving things that way. All too often, workers would drive right up on the grass, running over plants and such. We had a so-called electrician arrive who shocked himself off the latter enough times. We honestly thought we were going to need to dial 911 to save his life. He left burn marks on fixture ceilings and wired the garage so poorly we couldn't shut off the lights and the door bell quit working. I complained to David **, my adjuster with USAA insurance, but all he did was talk over me, put us on 3-way calling and listen to us argue or as he was fond of doing, ask me ill gained questions about VBS or employees of VBS and then informed me they had been listening on the other end of the line all along. There was a constant demand I kept making of the employees to clean up after themselves especially in the toilet that went unheeded. The broken security sensor on the bedroom window still has yet to be replaced. A garage door was wired wrong and the small garage door leaks water in the garage because an aluminum flange at the bottom of the door was never installed. In the middle of the Christmas holiday while our house was full of guests, USAA and VBS both wanted their carpet pulled from the entire home. It was only after I raised a lot of fuss about how that was going to look real bad and make conditions very difficult that they both agreed to wait. It was at this point I decided to ""cash out"" the issue and attempt to complete the remaining tasks on my own. After notifying my adjuster, he told VBS to write it up and submit it. After receiving a copy of both revised bids, I attempted to discuss them with my adjuster and it aggravated him so I had to ask for a new adjuster. On 5 January 2012, I called several insurance companies to see what they had listed on file about my claims. To my amazement, all it said they were shown closed and paid. Later that day, I received a rather disturbing call from a man I could barely understand, who said he literally just moved in from Michigan and who had so much noise on his phone. I could not understand him. When he called back, he was hitting his own phone buttons so much it wasn't any easier. I simply told him he had no idea of conditions in Arizona, was coming in on a very bad situation I'd bet he had not been properly briefed on and I was in no mood to deal with it. Currently, I have issues with Insurance not being available because I have filed two indoor claims within a 10-year period or some such nonsense. You think USAA would have let me know this was going to be an issue. As it is, I'm a hostage to them now. There is also the issue about USAA not pursuing a lawsuit against the faulty utility company as promised. They simply asked the utility company to pay and when the utility company responded no, USAA dropped the case. I am trying to get USAA to drop my auto insurance rates to the $93 premium they promised. Not only am I paying far more than that but it shows no end in sight and the payments are all over the place (inconsistent).",876

I got the copy of the report and called his insurance USAA. He had not reported that he was involved with another car. He had just stated he had an accident.  The rep was rude and ill mannered. She had no information about me or my vehicle. I told her that he rear-ended me and it wasn't surprising since he tried to run. ""Well, we are NOT taking responsibility for this accident since he said nothing about hitting you."" Really, I have the accident report stating he did and it was his fault but since he didn't say it, they are taking his side.

When I called USAA, just before my policy was about to end, they told me that I do not have to cancel my policy and to just basically let it run out. I then received a bill from USAA a few weeks later to pay for the policy. When I called them about this, they said that they will cancel the policy. Then about a month later, I received another bill from USAA saying that I owe them $83. When I called, they said that it was because I did not cancel my policy (when they told me that was not necessary in the first place).

At the time of the incident he was estranged from me and staying with his mother, so he did not notify me and I discovered it just before sending him off to a wilderness program and boarding school. The truck was not driveable after the dunking and he left it in a transmission shop. I put the truck in my repair shop and told them there was no hurry. Some time later, in talking to the shop, I became aware that I could file a claim for water damage with my insurer. I did so. By then the truck was in the body shop and that shop did not initiate repairs but awaited USAA's OK.  That was about 6/20 and the truck is still in the body shop.  Initially USAA could possibly have refused coverage of the water damage due to my late reporting of the claim and their inability to see the truck before the major mechanical repairs were done (some remain to be done, but USAA isn't considering them and has closed the claim).

I told him that I didn't want it totaled. USAA classified it as totaled and provided a 14-page Market Valuation Report listing base value at $6,825.00. What caught my eye was on page 4. The vehicle's value was reduced by 3 items. Two of those I accept, but the 4th is unacceptable. The interior was reduced by $553.00 due to heavy mud inside veh, veh full of tools. We had not cleaned the vehicle after the accident so as not to change anything.  I had received nothing from USAA, stating that this would impact their valuation nor allow me to correct this issue before their valuation. I have disputed this with USAA, but to no avail.

Started with USAA because there was no war clause in their life insurance, and continued with them for all insurance needs throughout my military career and subsequent retirement. Also, in the last 10 years or so I've used their wealth management services. I have considered USAA as a partner with whom I could be totally candid and use them to advise me on the best courses of action.  But, a couple of years ago I happened to mention to one of their customer service reps that I had repaired, out of pocket, some damage I did to my car when I scraped a pillar in a parking garage. She told me that was considered an at fault accident, I should have reported it and that she was going to submit a claim and that would affect my insurance rates. After talking with a couple supervisors, I finally got that sorted out -- I think (who knows what they have in their computers). No longer will I be off guard when talking to them about any issues. Regarding ""Wealth Management"". I no longer use their financial planners. They changed planners every six months or so and were not structured to handle my individual stocks heavy account. I need someone who is familiar with my account who can advise my heirs when I pass or become unable to manage the portfolio. I have since secured the services of a private fin planner; interestingly one who serviced my account before leaving USAA. I still have a brokerage account with them - using them to buy/sell -- and am reasonable happy. Most noticeable in my interface with USAA is the customer service reps. ""Back in the day"", they were former or retired military who were knowledgeable and experienced, who I could rely upon to have my best interest at heart and with whom I felt I could partner. No longer. Today, they seem to be just entry level kind of young folks for whom this is just a job. Oh, they call me by my rank and thank me for my longevity with USAA. (Incidentally, that rank thing is of no importance to me - I'm not one to glory in that; that was a different life.)  In any event, that insurance rep was, for me, the denouement of a gradual change in USAA. The proverbial Rubicon, so to speak. From that point on I will never again volunteer info to them and don't feel that I can trust USAA to be a valued adviser with my best interest at heart.

Over the last year I have reported checking account fraud and illegal withdrawls from my checking account on five seperate occasions. USAA did nothing to stop or resolve the problem. I had to resort to having my money deposited to a bank in Denmark because the risk of using the USAA account was too high.  Becaause USAA did nothing to stop the illegal withdrawls the account soon overdrew and they closed the checking account without notificaiton. As the dollar went lower I decided to have my pay (I am paid in USD)sent to my USAA account this September. I logged into my account to find the checking closed but the savings was opened. I called USAA to indicate that I would send my next pay check to my still opened savings account. I changed all my bank details to have my money sent to USAA however, again without notification USAA closed the savings account 2 weeks after speaking with them on the phone.

At first, the services were great; charges were made and monthly payments were low. Granted my interest rate was/is 17% percent, but I've been on time with my payments. In fact, I nearly always paid $50 dollars more than the minimum balance, using the auto-payment method via telephone. For the past three months, my minimum payments due ranged about $120 dollars on a $6,999 balance (don't ask). I paid $150 in order to remain ahead. But one day, my card was strangely being declined despite sufficient credit available. Today, I decided to take a closer look at my statements and began noticing EXCESSIVE ""Interest on purchases"" charges. For example, I submitted a payment of $172 dollars as denoted by the auto-teller ""minimum payment due"" amount. The payment processed and interest was removed, yielding me about $120 dollars of available credit. Two days later after payment submission, my available credit was dropped to $16 dollars. Logged into USAA member service center to learn that NOT ONLY was interest removed from my payment, but an ADDITIONAL $102.71 of ""interest charges on purchases"" was deducted from my card (debited), leaving me with just $16 dollars. Their answer? According to USAA, I was behind on my card, and this results in a 1% percent interest charge on remaining card balances for each day you're overdue.... something of this sort. I replied, ""That's higher than title loans! How could my credit card interest be 17% percent with nearly $150.00 dollars of interest payments from a single month's payment?"" They then explained that I've been behind on my card since August 2014 (it is now Oct 2014). Yet the statement DOES NOT reflect my account being delinquent. And the more you try paying, THE MORE interest they pull out, thus causing your balance to remain near maximum, IF NOT OVER. Summary: USAA is manipulating the interest charges by not informing you of account delinquencies, despite account technically being paid-on-time. You'll go round and round with the service representative, and they will insist you are behind. As of now, they're telling me the minimum payment due for October is $322 dollars despite me paying $172 as required by the auto-teller AND my billing statement. Yet they CLAIM my actual minimum payment due is $348 dollars. The SCAM is misleading customers who believe they are on time, yet behind closed doors they are manipulating the true balances and charging EXCESSIVE interest on payments AND on purchases, thus leading to very high payments.

I ended up with another company at 7% interest rate... Next I needed my car insured, they offered me $220 a month, and I ended up with same coverage for $99 from Progressive. Next I wanted to start building my credit up some more so I saw USAA had in the ""my offers"" area of my online banking a credit card I could apply for, so, I did. They denied me.  I called to complain about all of this and see if anything could be done, why was I continuously being offered such horrible rates while (reputable) civilian companies were offering me such better deals. I just kept getting read from a script. I asked if there was anything that could be done and again I would just get read the same script over and over, my questions were not even acknowledged. I didn't want to lose my temper so I just hung up. It seems to me those who have ""great"" experiences with USAA all have great credit, and never have any major problems they have to deal with. If you have a less than perfect financial record I would advice looking elsewhere. You would think joining the military would give you a bit of credibility considering having financial issues in the military could mean a lot of trouble. But USAA, which deals exclusively with military, gives me less slack than civilian companies, doesn't make too much sense to me.

I was new to the military and was purchasing my first car. Usually in a bank you can talk to someone, maybe put down a bigger down payment, etc. With USAA I called multiple times, spoke to supervisors and all and was just told every time to re-apply online, there is nothing they can do. So, I reapplied, was offered $15,000 loan at 18% Interest. The entire reason I called and spent so much time was because I wanted a lower interest rate, I was willing to put a bigger down payment. I ended up with a local credit union with 6% interest for a $10,000 loan. Another time I had my card stolen and called to cancel it, they ended up canceling my wife's card after I told them multiple times which card it was and asked for confirmation they were canceling the correct card. Luckily the card was never charged before I resolved the problem, I could not imagine dealing with them with something like that. I now have decent credit, yet their insurance rates are horrible. 30 year old male, no accidents, 760 credit score, driving for 14 years, and they are offering over $70 a month more than anyone else.

We chose to file the claim against his liability insurance, so we would not have to make one against our insurance; and therefore, pay the deductible on repairs upfront. This was a mistake in hindsight since I had no advocate to help me fight with USAA besides myself and my body shop of choice. As instructed, I took the damaged car to a USAA Gerber body shop for an estimate; we were then told we could get repairs made at any body shop of our choice, as per Illinois state law. If our body shop had additional costs for a different estimate, they would need to contact USAA directly for a supplement and payment for that additional work. We chose to take our car to a Volkswagen licensed repair body shop since it was, as I said earlier, 4 days old! I am glad we turned to this body shop since the ""estimate"" given for the work at Gerber (USAA affiliate) was a cursory look while the car was still parked in the parking lot of their shop. The work was of course more extensive once fenders were removed, etc. Our chosen body shop followed protocol, and they were waiting to hear from USAA for over 2 days on our behalf before they were given a response from USAA that ""additional review"" would be necessary for the supplement in the estimate of repairs. I began to contact USAA at this point, on behalf of the body shop, to see what could be expected, since at this point, I was informed that I may be financially responsible for the rental car I was given through USAA. I spoke with 3 different employees at USAA and every time was told a different story and different lengths of time for his body shop estimate review. USAA was clearly dragging their feet since I was not interested in having my car repaired at their selected body shop, where they clearly have prices set. I informed them that this was against state law, and the USAA employee's only response was to ask me why I ""didn’t just file a claim against my own insurance then.” As I said, I should have been knowing what I know now. Liability was determined immediately in this accident, and it is insane to me that an insurance company would drag their feet like they have and be as uncooperative as they have with my chosen body shop, considering the costs to that body shop and my rental car will all need to be covered by their insured. No employee I spoke with at USAA seemed to care in the slightest that expediting all of this would save them money in the end and that telling me to get my repairs at their approved Gerber body shop was in any way the incorrect thing to say. I am just glad after all of this that USAA is not my insurance company because I would be embarrassed for the service I received with my claim.

I had no idea, as my husband called to take me off completely. It was a pretty mean divorce and he did not tell me. He told me I still had car insurance. I had spoken to USAA a week before to sign up for a temporary policy where I would be covered on a car I was borrowing. They were going to send my insurance cards, which I never received. I had no idea my insurance had been cancelled, USAA did not call me to verify or anything. They thought it was perfectly normal to just completely remove a spouse on insurance policy without asking if I wanted my own policy.  This was an extremely difficult situation as I then had no car insurance for a couple of weeks and had no idea. This to me is the equivalent of taking someone off a bank account without permission. This company is horrible and I will never go back to them ever again. When I questioned one of the customer service ladies all she said was, ""What would you have said?"" That I need insurance you idiot. She then refused to talk to me about MY policy at all because my husband was the one who made the change. I cannot believe the level of customer service representatives they have working there. They are great if you have no complaints, but once you have an issue they are unwilling to do anything to help or to even think about the situation. A divorce is not a situation where you should just be allowed to completely remove the spouse without both people being notified. I literally received nothing regarding this change.",957

I woke up early to make sure it sent because of course it should have being I had well over the amount to pay it. YOUR SIDE SCREWED UP.

During the time that the mechanic had my car, the mechanic wrecked the whole front end of my car. I spent weeks trying to get through to the mechanics to find out about the car's initial problem and what exactly it was. It ended up being related to a previous accident claim (exhaust). All was well until I finally got my car back over a MONTH later. Mechanic's fault not USAA, but I finally had my answer as to why no calls of mine were being returned for weeks. On To USAA, I filed a claim for the wrecked front end on my car, done by mechanics and finally admitted to by them as, ""an employee had wrecked my car."" USAA send out the Adjuster and then files ""closed claim"" because it was wrecked when he went up to the shop to view exhaust damage! I had no idea the car had been wrecked until I finally got to pick it up OVER a MONTH later! So, USAA knew the car had been wrecked but closed out the claim without my knowing the mechanics had wrecked my car. And this makes sense, HOW? They cancelled the estimate for repairing wreck damage? I have a lot of pictures before and after the mechanic wrecked it to show it WAS in original condition. Another note from recently, someone with USAA had changed my Home Policy Info. To state, I had like 5 bathrooms (my house has a bath for every room?) changed the date for the roof (under 10 years) to a 1985 roof, changed other info as well and were overcharging me for who knows how long (all those bathrooms might flood?).

At 1:30pm we called to see if the pick up time was still the same so we could make sure to be there on time and to confirm time of arrival with the repair shop.

We immediately called USAA to find out what was going on (no one told us about overages when we first called it in or requested payment from us at any point during this ordeal).

Finally, I made a complaint and got the supervisor of the adjuster on the phone.

The supervisor called Collision Pro and called me back his exact words ""you will have your car in 8 days."" I called Collision Pro the next day and spoke to the Manager, he said that he did not know when my car would be ready because he had taken the engine and the transmission out and they were cutting the fenders out.

Unfortunately, I was also told we wouldn't be getting our good faith deposit back because the appraisal already happened.

This makes no sense! We paid $350 for incompetence!!  If we were going to be denied from the very beginning because of numbers from our tax returns, then why did anybody have the decency to calculate this number earlier before the appraisal or even schedule the appraisal after someone punched a few numbers into a computer calculator to get this number?! And how is it that something as simple as explaining to your customer how to calculate their residual income and debt-to-income ratios can't be a part of the upfront pre-qualification process? Instead you string them along for 2 weeks, make them pay this good faith deposit, and then say “Sorry we finally got our act together and your numbers won't work for us.”  We have been banking with USAA for a long time now.

Mom was Air Force, so she got me the account when I went off to school so I could have a debit card and not just deal with cash. That being said, they treat me like a criminal, an idiot, and a person with buckets of money to just fling around. Several things have gone on. Firstly, I have their mobile app. I check my balance regularly. REGULARLY. Like every few hours! I'll check before I go grocery shopping and have $500. I'll spend $50. I'll come out and be overdrawn the next day without spending another penny after that. Why? ""Oh, well your previous purchases have just processed!"" Umm... It's a debit card. This is a mobile app. These things are supposed to reflect changes in real time. I've had about 10 different issues with fraudulent ATM withdrawals in the past six months. They put the money back, but it takes forever. They also shut off my debit card (for good reason), but unless I remind them that it's my ONLY way of paying for things right now, they try to ship it via regular mail.I. E. It takes ""7-10 business days"" to get here. Tack on a weekend, and it's two weeks before I can spend a single penny of my own money. So I tell them they need to make it priority mail. Okay. 2-3 business days. Except today is Friday, which means I won't get it until Wednesday or Thursday. Without even asking if I need to withdraw cash first, the representative I'm on the phone with about this crap just shuts down the debit card. I have about an eighth of a tank of gas, $5 cash, and almost no food in my apartment. How exactly am I expected to eat, get to work, and buy groceries? They don't care. ""The process is irreversible. Thanks."" The saga continues! They willy-nilly decide when they will put a hold on my funds. I deposit checks through the mobile app because I live nowhere near a physical location of theirs. Usually it's no problem. In fact, my boyfriend got a $2400 check and signed it over to me. I deposited that via mobile with zero issues. A few months later, I have a $50 check to deposit. They try to put a hold on my account. Umm... ""Thanks, but I need this money NOW in order to pay YOU for my credit card bill!"" They keep doing this lately. I call to try to understand when and why they put holds on things. The guy just keeps saying that USAA reserves the right to do that when the computer's algorithm says to. No details. Nothing. Then I say, ""But you're not explaining anything. I need to know what situations make this happen so I can avoid them when I'm in a hurry!"" He hangs up. I'm sick and tired of paying bills only to have USAA wait 7+ days to actually make the payment. By that time, I've assumed the money has come out and buy my gas and groceries as usual. Then I overdraft. Then the payment bounces, and whomever I'm paying charges me a fee for insufficient funds. Then USAA charges me overdraft fees on top of that even though they are the ones doing this to me. Multiple times in the last few months, I have found myself donating plasma in desperation for some money to eat and buy gas because my account was in the negative even though I had several hundred dollars less than twelve hours prior. It gets better, though! I had just moved last July, and my previous landlord basically extorted me for $1200. Then one of my housemates stole $300 cash from me, so I'm out $1500 plus whatever I spent moving out of the old and into the new. I'm in orientation for my new job, and I decide to check my account to see how much I can spend on gas that day. I'm in the negative. Why? So I call them up while I'm supposed to be working, and they keep running me in circles. I finally figure out that although I spent money at Walmart DAYS ago, the money is JUST NOW coming out of my account. Again. So there's no way to remedy that, so I say, ""I'm desperate. I have nothing, and I need to drive 40 minutes one way to orientation every day this week. My first paycheck doesn't come for another 2.5 weeks."" The woman suggests a personal loan. ""How much are you looking to borrow?"" I say, ""$1,000 at most!"" Silence. ""Oh, well our smallest loans start at $2500, but you could borrow that much and immediately pay off what you don't need."" ""Alright. Let's do it."" ""Oh, sorry. You're being denied due to insufficient credit history."" I've been a customer for SEVEN YEARS, and I had just gotten the credit card a year and a half ago. Not a single payment had been late up until that point, and I would pay off the entire balance every time. But sorry, that's not good enough for USAA! She then suggests I try to open a second credit card with them and happily transfers me to the correct department. The next woman runs my information through and once again, I am denied. Except this time they don't explain. I'm just not qualified enough for a second credit card, so I get to starve and lose my new job because I can't get to it without gas in my car. It all managed to work out, but I had to borrow money from my family to make things work. It was terrible. I can't wait to find a new (hopefully local) bank to do my business with. USAA has stolen enough of my time, sanity, energy, and (most importantly) money. You should be ashamed of yourselves, USAA.",980

This accident was clearly his fault and he was cited, and USAA did admit responsibility. However dealings with the company from that point forward have all been difficult. First I submitted my estimate via email, and received a confirmation email. I heard nothing back about the claim so I called. I left a message with the adjuster Jason (I may have spoken to him very briefly prior to getting my estimate but I never spoke to him after that time). Jason did not call me back. I called back and reached someone else who said they did not have my estimate, BUT that there was a ""limits issue"" with the insurance. I didn't see how that could be the case - the car accident occurred in Ohio and there is a $25,000 minimum in Ohio, so that would apply - the adjuster said that they were ""looking into that"" (how does an Ohio certified adjuster not know that?). I sent the estimate again, and then had to wait for AIS to verify the estimate. I received a call from AIS saying I needed to get an estimate. I said I sent the estimate twice to USAA so AIS had to call USAA to get the estimate (which the USAA person said they had already sent to AIS). I waited a few more days, and called the adjuster, Jason (who again never called me back). I then received an email confirmation that the claim would be paid. I called back to see about scheduling the repair and the rental car and again left a message with Jason (who again never called me back). So I called again and got someone else who helped me with the rental car, and said that the rental car would only be covered while the car was in the shop getting repaired. Of course. So I receive the rental car, and my car is in the shop, unable to be driven. Since it is a 2016 Range Rover they're having trouble getting some of the parts. Since the car that rear ended me dove under my car and hit the exhaust they really couldn't see all the damage until they got under the car and took it apart. After 1 week my car still was not ready, but then I started getting calls from the rental car agency that the insurance company is not going to pay for the rental car past 1 week. I call back and again get the adjuster, Jason's, voice mail and leave a message which he does not return again (I haven't spoken with him since BEFORE I sent my estimate!) I call back and get another adjuster on the phone. They tell me that they explained when I took the rental car that they only cover the active repair time in the shop which means if the car is waiting for parts it's not active repair time, despite the fact that my car cannot be driven. This obviously was NOT clearly explained to me. They said I shouldn't have taken my car to the shop on a Thursday or Friday (I think I asked if they cover weekends and was told they would) - I didn't take my car in on Thurs or Fri. I took my car to the shop on a Monday, thank you very much - they then claim they never received the supplement (to the estimate, sent by the shop earlier in the week). They don't have a lot of credibility regarding receiving the supplement since they also claimed they didn't receive the estimate I sent them. I still don't know if they're going to cover the rental car. I was told to call back but not right away because they wouldn't call me with the information even after they received the information from the shop - I still haven't spoken with the actual claims adjuster for my claim since prior to the estimate. He has not returned any of my calls. AND THEIR CLIENT HIT ME!

The other driver, JL did not contact USAA until he was contacted by them. We were advised that a person, RL, would be handling our claim.

I live in New England, the weather has been brutal, I am considered ""essential personnel"" and drive in any weather, usually in a very sure footed Jeep (I had just put four new snow tires on at the time of the accident).  Instead, I have been driving around in a vehicle that is less than adequate for the road conditions and my safety has often been compromised. USAA keeps trying to get me to send the title to the vehicle, probably so they can close the claim on their terms. Judging from what I have read of other people's experiences with USAA, this rudeness, verbal abuse, and attempts to wear down a person is corporate policy and not just one ill-mannered employee.

The car that hit me caused a lot of damage to the rear and quarter-panel of my car, along with the front end where it shoved me into a cement wall.  What I nightmare I had dealing with this company! I have been insured with USAA for over 25 years, and have unfailing sent them a check every month to insure numerous cars, boats, and rental units. It took them over two weeks to call the car totaled. Then they would only give me $1000 on a car that I had just rebuilt the engine on. When we asked what exactly we were supposed to buy with $1000 that had a new engine, new tires, T-tops, and had been reupholstered, we were told that was our problem. I faxed in over $5000 in receipts for this car, but because we did the rebuilt job ourselves, we were told the receipts were simply maintenance. They would not simply start the car and see that it ran like a top, nor look at the tires to see that they were nearly new. So, I, who did nothing wrong, am currently out of a car, and now have a whopping $1000 to pay for a new one. Bluebook put the car at closer to $3000 without a new engine, but USAA said they don't go by Bluebook values. Apparently, they just pull a number out of a hat, and that's what you get stuck with. USAA will of course collect from the other persons insurance so they will be out nothing. Oh, and I had full coverage on this car for over 10 years. But I did not have a replacement clause on the policy. So they were happy to take my checks for full coverage for 10 years, but when it came time to pay up - well, good luck!. Like the other gentlemen stated, I figure I have sent them $25,000 to $35,000 since I have been with them with one claim in 1982 that they paid $800 on, and perhaps four tows since then. We only got the rental car for 30 days, even though it took them 3 weeks to tell us how much we were getting. It took 32 days for them to FINALLY send our $1000. Their adjusters NEVER answer the phone, and when they finally call you back, they act like they are doing you a big favor. Rude, insensitive, and unprofessional. I will switch to another company as soon as I can, and get the cheapest coverage I can, as the more expensive insurance does absolutely nothing for you. I am so disgusted with this company.

I had to check very carefully to determine that my ""actual"" account balance is $19.00 (I'm unemployed at the moment). The real stickler, USAA won't show the TRUE amount until I, thinking I have $69.00 in my account, go out and buy something for $20.00, then they will go ahead and post that previous $50.00 bill payment, and will charge me a very large overdraft fee, and have snotty rude reasons to deny me my own money in the future.

We live in California and they seemed to have never done a loan in California, at least that is how I felt as they did not know how California real estate goes. They were late getting everything to the escrow company, the processor was very hard to reach, and they had us do some of their leg work because they were having trouble doing it themselves.  My wife called to try and get help with something they were needing and the man she spoke with had her in tears. It appears to me they do not fully train their processors on procedure. Our processor was very friendly but she was not aware that California is an escrow state so they almost screwed up the closing. It was an all-out horrible experience and I am so glad it's over. Never again will I get a loan with USAA.",1037

I was rear ended by a person driving a vehicle that they had borrowed from a friend, who was insured by USAA on September 17th, 2011. I called USAA and filed a claim on September 19th, 2011. They suggested that I get the vehicle damage appraised at one of their preferred shops. I took the vehicle to the shop and the person at the shop doing the estimates refused to give an estimate; because the vehicle needed to be taken apart in order to get an accurate estimate. So I took the vehicle back and notified USAA that the vehicle needs to be disassembled to get an accurate estimate. Then, USAA gave me an annoying runaround about how a preliminary estimate would be fine. I got into a small debate with the Claims Rep as to why I had to use aftermarket parts cheaper than OEM, but I eventually gave up. They also assumed liability and put in a work order that would permit their preferred body shop to work on the vehicle; after I took the vehicle back a second time and got a preliminary estimate that equated out to about $1500 on October 7th, 2011. The shop had approval to work on the vehicle and I was already being hounded by Enterprise Rent A Car, as they too had approval from USAA to rent me a car on USAA's behalf. The body shop rep told me to not drive the vehicle and get into a rental car on that day, but I insisted to follow the guidelines of USAA and wait to bring the vehicle in on Monday, October 10th, 2011. I eventually got the vehicle into the shop on Monday and I was in a rental car, with nothing more than a $50 deductible. All was well. Tuesday, October 11, 2011, I got a phone call from Enterprise telling me that I need to put more money down on the vehicle in order to keep it because USAA had suddenly reneged on their commitment to paying for the rental car and I had to pay $20 everyday for a rental. I called back USAA extremely aggravated by their 180. Their reply was that someone had goofed up in the claims department and approved the work on my car too soon. They still had to get confirmation from the owner of the vehicle whether or not he allowed his friend to drive his car. But for whatever reason, they thought it fit to throw me under the bus for their own **. I got into a debate with them about how they could possibly pull a reversal on such a huge commitment, especially since they should have notified me ""before"" I put the car in the shop and had it dismantled. By this point, the damage estimate on the vehicle was just under $4,000 damage. Another debate to no avail. The next day, October 12th, 2011, I got a call from their preferred body shop saying that USAA called and told them to halt all work on the vehicle. They had just fully disassembled it by this point. So I called them back wondering what is the big hold up? They replied that despite their initial goof up, they still have to wait for confirmation from their client; who by the way just happened to be deployed in the military. That made me absolutely vexed. That soldier could be gone for months, heaven forbid he actually dies. After that debate, about 1 hour later, I got a call from the Enterprise rep telling me that I have to cover the full expense of the rental. He was asking for $250 plus $48 for renting the vehicle on the 10th and 11th.",1038

"1041",41393.51,"KEVIN","Corvallis","OR",1,"credit",44.5502905,-123.31959825,"I have been with USAA since 2005. Almost all of my experiences have been wonderful, except with their credit card services. Most people on here are posting novels, so I will try and keep it short, sweet and to the point. I received a credit card with a limit of $8,000. I had a balance on it close to the limit. Once I could afford it, I started putting large payments at it to try and get the balance down low/gone. I went to use the card after paying a few thousand dollars on it, only to be surprised and horribly embarrassed when I was told that my card was declined due to insufficient funds. Thinking that there must have been some incredible error on the bank or store's part, seeing as how I had just made some massive (massive to me, at least) payments, I called USAA to find out what in the world was going on.  They told me that my credit limit was no longer $8,000 and had been dropped to what I owed with no explanation. They offered to put in a request to raise the limit. Of course, I said yes please because I knew that I had great credit and that it must have just been a fluke. That was a mistake. I was denied and told that I would receive a letter in the mail explaining to me why I was denied. I also noticed after this that every time I made a payment now, they would drop my credit limit to whatever I paid the balance down to. Every time they dropped my limit, they never even sent me a letter or notification of any kind to tell me that my limit had been decreased. It turns out that a rental company had put a collection out on an old roommate and myself. The rental company had messed up and forgot that I was deployed and was no longer on the lease. Fast forward a little bit and I came into some small financial trouble. My only route of staying afloat was to use my credit card, which I had credit available on. I had recently checked to make sure that it wasn't being dropped every time I made a payment still (the limit all the way down to $2,400 at this point). Well they had done it again out of the blue even though my balance had been well below the limit for months at this point and so a couple of bills were late being paid, which obviously doesn't help my credit situation. Now I'm in a situation again where I need a small amount of credit. Well they just tacked the interest on for my upcoming bill and it put my credit card $3.00 over the limit. So seeing as how the collection that was put out on me has been resolved and I only need a $600 increase, I think that I won't have any problem. It turns out I think too much because they said that I am again denied. This has been over 3 years since they started all this, by the way, and I have had maybe five 30-day late payments of sorts. They, of course, denied me yet again and the only thing they could tell me was again, ""You will receive a letter in the mail explaining to you that you were denied the increase."" I asked her if there was anything they could do as I am in a desperate situation and tried to explain things to her including the whole ordeal with the credit **. She went to talk to the manager and came back with the answer, still being that they cannot help me in any way whatsoever. The only reason she gave me was that the supervisor wasn't willing to try and do anything for me because I was $3 over my limit. Thank you USAA. You have made my day.",1041
"1043",42097.03,"KEVIN","Medford","OR",1,"banking",42.323997,-122.857455,"In 2012 I bought a new car. The dealer told me as a veteran I could get great insurance rates through USAA. He gave me the number and I called from his office. The representative told me in order to be a member I had to open a checking account with $10.00. He then offered me a CD and an American Express. My son was 17 and I thought this would be a great way to get him started with a checking account. They required $100.00 to open his account. I funded it with my debit card. That day my wife got a new quote on insurance and we saved nearly $600 for the year... so I called USAA to cancel the auto insurance... around and around we went. Finally they canceled it. However, they still keep billing me $228.92 for insurance we never had. Then a few days later I got a call from USAA that there was a problem with my son's checking account. But he needed my son's permission to talk to me. My son was not home. The next day I had my son call. There was some error that the agent made while opening the account and we needed to open a new account. Fine... they could not just transfer the $100.00, I needed to give them another $100.00. This just didn't sound right... so I told them just to close the account and once I received the $100 back we would call and open a new account. I was not authorized to close the account and my son was not authorized to order the refund. The only thing we could do was close the account and give them another $100.00 to open a new account. To this day USAA has NEVER refunded the money. That's not all... I liked have the American Express that I got through USAA because the interest was very low. I had a balance of just over $200.00. I usually paid it off each month but the month before my wife had some medical bills come in... so I made a small payment of $50.00. The next month I logged in to make a payment (pay off the $200) and I could not find the AMEX card account. I called them and explained that I logged in and couldn't find the AMEX account to make payment. After some searching the rep said, ""Ok, you are several days late on making your payment this month...as per your contract we have applied one of your CDs to your credit card and paid it off and cancelled the card."" WHAT!!! Not only was I on time, I was 3 days early.  After some check the rep agreed that they made a mistake. The only thing I could do is reapply after 6 months for a new AMEX card but he was happy to fund another CD for me now. I said forget it!!! And believe it or not there is more!!!! My $10.00 checking account which I was required to open to become a member and get all these other ""fabulous"" benefits... I received a letter saying that the account was overdrawn just over $100.00. What? I called them and they said I had 11 attempts to withdraw $10.95 from PayPal. I said that was impossible. The agent was very nice. She told me she could remove 4 of the overdraft charges and I could call back and the next agent could do the same until they were all gone... or I could get a letter from PayPal. I opted to just get it over with one swoop. I contacted PayPal, they sent a letter stating that they had not attempted payment through the account and that now nor not ever had I ever had a PayPal account attached to my USAA account. Sounded pretty definitive to me. I faxed it into the provided fax and to the attention of the agent I spoke with at USAA. I called back in a few days. I got a different agent who said they received the letter and that my account had been credited and closed as per my final request. I logged into my USAA account, sure enough... no more checking account. Because I had so many issues with USAA, I mean EVERY SINGLE PRODUCT, I decided I was done with them. I would even write off the $100 they stole from me on my son's account. More than a year later I get a letter in the mail from a collection agency. USAA is trying to collect $171.41 for a checking account. I called the collection agency... man was that lady not nice. I understand she represents her client but all I wanted her to do is kick it back to her client saying I disputed it. She read me the riot act. I told her to calm down and talk to me like a human or I was going to hang up. Well... I hung up. STAY FAR, FAR AWAY FROM USAA. Their mantra of serving vets is just a cleaver finance company praying on veterans. Some of us come back from combat and just want to spend time with our families so we trust a company like this with our money... BIG MISTAKE.

Go to your local credit union, they have many of the same products, you can sit across the desk with the agent that you will see every time you visit.

The problem began when I took the vehicle in for a repair estimate at Hendrick Collision Center. This is one of the USAA-preferred repair facilities. The estimate prepared by Matt ** was almost $5,000, which I was told would total the vehicle. This information has been communicated to USAA and I am being told the information is being transferred to the Total Loss department. I retrieved the vehicle from Hendrick Collision to obtain additional estimates. The additional estimates are less than half of the estimate provided by Matt. USAA is telling me that other facilities do not have the equipment and abilities of their preferred facility.  This is quite confusing since Hendrick Collision did not dismantle the car to see the real damage. They must have some really awesome technology and abilities. The other appraisers looked at my car with the rear bumper cover removed and were able to see the real damage. I have requested that USAA send another appraiser to look at my car and so far this has been denied. I have also asked for photos provided by Hendrick Collision and I have not received them yet (This is text from first submission to the BBB and Insurance Commissioner). After receiving our complaint through the Better Business Bureau, USAA did finally send another adjuster out to look at the vehicle on October 16. After the adjuster looked at the vehicle and stated what needed to be repaired, I asked him if the car was totaled. His reply was, ""No, it's not totaled."" I showed him the original estimate from Hendrick Collision and he said the adjuster needs to be fired. On October 17, I spoke with my claim person, Elizabeth **. She reviewed the notes from the second adjuster and his supervisor and advised me that they would be issuing a check for the repair the next day. When I asked her why I had to jump through so many hoops to get the second estimate, she said, ""I don't know, but this may be the straw that broke the camel's back."" I am not sure exactly what she meant by this, but I took it to mean this had happened before and USAA would be fixing the problem. The Total Loss department has been in touch with me since the conversation with Elizabeth and they are using information from the original bogus estimate. As stated, USAA did send photos, but they are from the first adjuster and before the bumper cover was removed and do not reflect the real damage. When determining the value of the vehicle, they are also using bogus information. USAA is refusing to discuss any details with me (text from second BBB and Insurance Commissioner communication). We have taken the time to review each supposed comparable vehicle on the CCC list and of the 11 vehicles listed, only one vehicle is a potential comparable within the Georgia Codes and Regulations. USAA is violating Codes 33-7-11.1, 33-4-7, 33-6-34 and Regulation 120-2-52-.06. Also, Georgia uses Actual Cash Value, which is defined as the cost of replacing or restoring property at prices prevailing at the time and place of the loss, less depreciation, however caused. USAA is also participating in insurance fraud by knowingly making false statements. The original adjuster, Matt **, knew that he had not properly estimated repair on the vehicle. It is very basic knowledge that the original estimate is completed based on what can be seen and the vehicle is viewed again once the car is taken apart. Matt did not remove the bumper cover.

Neither party cared or noticed that I was waiting for them to move from blocking the intersection so I can go. The homeland security employee finally drives away and the truck in front of me floors his car in reverse and hits my car sitting at the stop sign. He gets out the truck and tells me he didn't notice me back there and his ""bad"" he just had something else to say to his friend in the homeland security truck. Meanwhile his friend is turning his truck around behind my car to check out the damage.  While I'm filing a claim with USAA these two are standing over to the side holding a conversation about their personal lives as if there wasn't just an accident. His truck wasn't damaged so he didn't care and he started to get impatient after a while and wanted to leave as if I was inconveniencing him (keep in mind he just slammed into my car and I had never been in accident until then and I've been driving for over 15 years). So USAA seemed to be extremely helpful at first. They got me a rental car while my car was in the shop and paid for it which I appreciate. I paid my deductible which I was not at fault for the accident so it should have been waived. It is about to go on two months now and the person assigned to my claim has not contacted me. I have to call them to see what's going on. I was told that the other driver is not complying in contacting USAA to give his statement and that they will keep attempting to contact him.  More time went by and I contact them again for the status of my claim and I was told he still haven't contacted them. I was also informed since it's a member to member that what ""might"" happen is they will drop his insurance and I would be able to sue him in small claims court for my deductible and the final decision may take some time (Unknown amount of time by the way). This had me baffled especially since I was told that they found him at fault but because he's USAA member they aren't going to reimburse me for my deductible. This leaves me paying for an accident that I did not cause and the other guy getting away with a slap on the wrist.  The person assigned to my claim hasn't given me information on my claim. I have to call them and find out what's going on and when I do get in contact with them I'm told the investigation is on going. I also contacted them several times through their app and was given a cold response that they will be back in contact with me when the decision have been made. What I am looking for out of an insurance company is for them to at least give me an update of what's going on. It doesn't have to constant as I am aware that I am not their only client but an email here or there saying that they are still working my claim instead of me having to contact the company every couple of weeks.  I am shopping around for new insurance because if ignoring a client and leaving the not at fault member paying for the accident is how they do business then I will take my money elsewhere. If this is how they respond for a minor accident which both parties walked away, then I can only imagine how horrible their service will be in a major accident with USAA member to member involvement. Also to add, a month after the accident I receive a letter stating that my insurance policy will be increasing due to accidents in my area. How conveniently after I just filed a claim for my first ever car accident.  This whole issue is stressful because I'm dealing with an USAA member who is purposely not contacting USAA and an insurance company that is protecting the at fault driver and themselves.

My 2-year-old son developed pneumonia and very high fevers over that next week. A week later, my husband went into surgery to start the first of a few surgeries to fix his broken ankles and leg. During surgery, he had a pulmonary embolism and I almost lost him. Back to the ICU and still intubated, I prepared to be induced to have my second child. From his ICU room and barely able to move or speak, my husband watched via Skype his daughter enter the world. He was in the hospital for a month before he came home in a wheelchair. My husband has been with USAA since he was a teenager. He served his country and has been a faithful USAA customer, paying every month and spreading the word of the great customer service we have always enjoyed having USAA. Until now. USAA assigned us a case manager who seemed very nice until we recently found she did many things that made us pay out of pocket for medications, had us making all the phone calls, make appointments, etc. She failed to send out paperwork that would allow us to be paid once his disability ran out. We never even knew that was her responsibility. Later, I noticed that she left the form out of all the paperwork she gave us. We ended up letting her go and having to get a lawyer and a case manager through our lawyer. We have paid for all but one medication out of pocket; they only let him leave for PT and doctor’s appointments and they will not provide transportation for him to go to church once a week. I have never been paid for attendant care and they have completely ignored all receipts I have faxed in twice. I was yelled at by my claims adjuster when I was trying to get a wheelchair ramp put in and they would not approve the claim. They approved it the night before he came home and it was put in 2 hours before he was to be discharged. They have paid one week of replacement services and that’s all. The worst of all is our disability ran out. We used up all my husband’s vacation days and our savings has been cleaned out. We are now down to $24 and a flat tire. I have a 3-month-old and a 2-year-old. I don't have enough money to buy my prenatals since I am breastfeeding and my iron supplements. My cupboards are down and I will have to visit a soup kitchen to get food. I can't drive anywhere because I have no money to fix my tire. I am extremely disappointed in a company that we thought was the most honest company out there. Dealing with companies like this make you lose faith in humanity. They will let their customers starve before they would pay out what was rightfully theirs. I would not recommend USAA to anyone and will always let people know the pain we have endured due to their unethical practices.",1054

Not my fault, it was the other driver who was at fault. On the 13th I dropped my vehicle off at my mechanic and picked up the rental vehicle that is covered by my insurance. It is now the 25th of October and my vehicle still has not been finished getting repaired. And they are refusing to extend my rental for 2 extra days. Now this makes no sense to me whatsoever. When my car was damaged (passenger side of vehicle both front and back doors side swiped) the company that was disclosed by USAA to purchase the new doors for my vehicle sent over USED AND DAMAGED doors. My mechanic sent the doors back to the company and was told that those are the only doors that they had in stock. So my mechanic had to find another vendor to purchase a new set of doors. So the delay in repairs has nothing to do with my mechanic. It has to do with USAA providing a SHODDY company who provided my mechanic with FAULTY doors and they're refusing to acknowledge anything on their end. Anyways, I was called by Enterprise on the 21st and told that I have to return my rental vehicle on the 25th. Immediately I contacted USAA and they told me don't worry I will be extended and covered by insurance. The day of, however, I get a call from Enterprise saying to return the vehicle. I then contact USAA and get told ""no you're not going to be extended. Return vehicle."" At this point I'm confused. I was told that I would be able to get an extension on my rental vehicle by my insurance company just 4 days prior. A few minutes later my mechanic contacts me and says that he got off of the phone with members from USAA and they told him that I don't need to worry about the rental vehicle because everything is processed. Meaning I can keep vehicle until the 28th. Which is the day my vehicle will be done with repairs. I tell him that I just got off of the phone with them and he advised me to contact them immediately. Which I did. And they told me no I would not be covered for an extension because of the delay in repairs. I then contacted my mechanic once more and told him what was relayed to me and he explains the door situation. So once more I contacted USAA and the representative tells me ""you will be covered for an extension until the 28th."" They later call me back and say that they are sending my account details to their manager for review. Because they are unsure if they can extend my rental vehicle. I spent the entire day back and forth with my mechanic and USAA only for me to get the WORST customer service. Representatives were refusing to give me their extensions so that I couldn't call them back. They THEN CALL MY MECHANIC AND TELL MY MECHANIC TO TELL ME THAT THEY HAVE A RECORDED CONVERSATION stating that they told me not to drop off my car until all parts were ordered and at the shop. They said that I picked up the rental vehicle on the 11th of October before I dropped off my personal vehicle on the 13th of October. Which is a complete lie. I picked up my rental vehicle the exact day that I dropped off my personal vehicle which is in fact on the 13th of October. I am 21 years old and I NEED my vehicle for work purposes. I live too far from my job to rely on public transportation. No matter how many times I have expressed my frustrations with the representatives I get absolutely nowhere. I don't feel that anybody who pays for service should be treated this way. I make my payments on time every month. I have been a great driver. No accidents prior to this incident. But this is absolutely unacceptable. Nobody deserves this. They have been giving me the runaround all day long. And at this point I am just returning the vehicle. I spoke with Enterprise and they were understanding and allowed me to keep the vehicle one more day. Free of charge. So I will be returning later today October 26th 2016. I cannot believe that this is the service that I pay for monthly. I am currently looking for a new insurance company. An insurance company that actually values their customers.",1056

My 1-year-old Honda Civic LX was hit by one of your drivers, resulting in structural damage totaling over $8,000 (and a trip to the hospital emergency room for a concussion). These damages were repaired and Geico certified, but unfortunately now I am unable to sell the vehicle privately as Carfax is reporting this structural damage and there are no interested buyers. AutoTrader offered me $5K and Carmax offered $7K, both claiming that the vehicle must be sold at auction as a result of the damages incurred. Kelley Blue Book lists my car at a value of $11K, yet I'm unable to get anything close to that from a potential buyer. To add to the situation, I still owe $9K on the vehicle, so I'm taking a significant loss by selling it (which I must as I moved to NYC). Given this, I hired an independent appraiser who certified that my diminished value is over $3,600. Your company responded to this appraisal by offering me only $1,100, and has repeatedly refused to negotiate. I had to reject that offer since that would not even allow me to pay off my car. I bought a Honda Civic because of how well they hold their value. Now I'm in a position where I need to PAY someone to take this car off my hands, or continue to make monthly car payments that are several thousand dollars ABOVE what the car is actually worth. After several months of back and forth with your company, I have gotten absolutely nowhere. I finally decided to simply accept the low ball offer and cut my losses, and now you're telling me that you'll no longer honor that, and will pay me NOTHING. Your new story is that the person who hit me did not have enough insurance to cover the full accident since it involved 4 vehicles. His maximum payment was only $25,000. Again, this is not my fault. My car was stopped in a traffic jam when your insured smashed into me from behind. I'm unclear on why USAA would allow someone to have such low coverage, knowing that this is likely not enough in the event of a serious accident, which is exactly what their driver caused. Unfortunately the state of CT (where I lived at the time), does not allow underinsured personal property damage coverage, so I am 100% having to take a LOSS of several thousand dollars due to your insured. Okay, you're in insurance company and this is how you operate. Fine, but I want the world to know that this is the type of treatment they give to the families of veterans in this country. Don't believe the BS they say about taking care of those that have served this country. They are only after their bottom line.

I have been a loyal member of USAA for more than 34 years. I've prided myself in being a valued customer. I've often been asked, over the years, to participate in surveys, in which I've been asked what it would take for me to change insurance companies. Always, I prided myself, and USAA, in reporting that I never wanted to change insurance providers. I WAS THAT happy. I must have spoken too soon, or perhaps my high regard for USAA was at least in large measure attributable to the fact that I have never filed a claim for any of my property. I am a careful person. I take care of my things, my car, my household goods, my personal and family possessions. I feel this is the duty of anyone, and certainly anyone holding property insurance. Imagine my surprise, if you can, after selling my home several years ago, and purchasing Renters insurance, plus Valuable Personal Property insurance - to discover that USAA doesn't actually cover anything. Because I am someone who derives some satisfaction out of knowing where I've failed (since I like to know what to avoid next time and avoid future mistakes), I surveyed everything I could on the USAA website, to see if perhaps I'd misunderstood. Sure enough, according to their website, USAA covers everything!!! Or certainly, they want you, the customer, or potential customer, to believe it's so! It ISN'T so. The test of your insurance, isn't whether the representatives are friendly and helpful, or whether they say they'll take care of you; nor is it the company's supposedly good reputation, which doesn't exist anymore. The test of a good insurance policy is whether your policy actually covers what you thought you were buying when you forked over your money. You won't know until something happens, if your policy will actually cover anything until you file a claim. Your insurance company will either pay your claim, or they won't. If they don't, they should have a very good reason. What I discovered is that despite my following all their instructions, being a very careful and conscientious customer, paying premiums month after month on multiple policies for years, none of my losses - on anything, of any kind - are covered. How convenient! A better form of insurance for me would have been to pay one of my friends or relatives $50 per month for years, in hopes they'd help me out if I really needed it; and in fact, most friends and relatives would do this anyway, and gasp at the thought of accepting money for it. And most strangers would be more helpful than USAA. What happened after years of being an honored and loyal customer, to warrant my need for USAA to actually come through on its promises? In my case, it was a torrential storm that swept through the entire area, breaking all records. It went on for days. It was in the national news. Power went out, electrical lines were down, high winds, hail, flash floods -- historic records for rainfall were broken that had been set 118 years ago, in 1898. The storm continued for days. It was scary and inconvenient, especially being without power. But I was safe and dry. Or so I thought. On around Day 4 of the storm, everything changed. Tons of rain started pouring into my house. It was observed to have entered through the ceiling in the Master closet. (I have since learned that rain probably entered through a broken skylight, damaged by hail.) The closet looked like the inside of a shower with all the spigots turned on, except no shower I've seen, except in a locker room, puts out that much water. The floor and carpet were supersaturated. Water leached laterally through the carpet and pad, all the way to the bathroom entrance, across the master bedroom, covering one-half the length of the entire upstairs suite. Everything in the closet was soaked. Hearing noises downstairs, I hurried down the staircase, and my worries were confirmed. Water was pouring through the ceiling of the first floor from the second level above. Everything was drenched. And the water was not clean. It was muddy, and left sediment on all the surfaces where it fell. My couch, loveseat, artwork, everything was drenched. There were 2 inches of water under my couch. Water standing on my coffee table, and sitting on my leather dining room chairs. My piano is right there. And wet. But that is not all. Water was also coming up from below the surface of the brick flooring, on the ground floor. Water was actually seeping into the living room, dining room, and kitchen from spaces between bricks that comprise the ground level floor surfaces, although there are no observable spaces between the bricks -- but water finds its way from areas of greater concentration to lesser concentration. So, water was coming into the first floor from both above, and below. (Exactly how it entered through the floor I'm not certain, but there must be spaces between the foundation and the brick pavers, although the property owner denies this, for some reason - possibly because it is a violation of building codes?) I have photos of all this. I contacted the property owner immediately. She lives in another state. I also contacted USAA immediately. The property owner, who is a customer of MetLife, did nothing. She said she was sorry. She said she'd pay for me to go to a hotel, but she didn't. She said she'd pay the exorbitant cost of ServiceMaster to run their equipment 24/7, but she didn't. I've been left holding the bag. And USAA said they'd pay for these things, but they haven't. They conveniently denied my claim. In my first call to USAA, while this disaster was taking place, the USAA representative said they'd contact someone in my area and that I'd receive a phone call in 24-48 hours. No one called. I heard from no one. They also told me I'd need to submit a complete list of damaged items, with photographs. A complete report, with lots of detail. And I should do it ASAP. By this time, my computer, printer, and office equipment were in water, and everything needed to be unplugged. I was able to convince the property owner that some mitigation company should be called. My things were soaking wet, and I didn't know what to do. She eventually go on that, and it wasn't until about a week later that I learned that her call to ServiceMaster was for the purpose of preserving HER property, and not mine. They eventually boxed up the contents of my closet, and sealed it tightly, whereafter I learned just last week, that all of my clothing is covered in mold and rotten or stained. So, it's been kind of hard to inventory all of it, until now. Meanwhile, USAA denied my claim anyway, based on a lot of inaccurate information they willingly solicited by anyone and everyone who had something to gain by giving inaccurate information (such as unlicensed adjusters), without actually inspecting the property, assessing the damage, or identifying the source of water entry, while totally denying everything I submitted, which is factual. I also have photos, eye witnesses, and evidence that contradicts her story she provided to USAA. Yet, USAA is denying my claim anyway. Now, they're encouraging me to start all over and file a Valuable Personal Property claim. I don't want to do that because I feel that if I do, it will allow them to close out my claim on my Renters policy, and I don't feel they've performed honorably or within the standard of care established expected or established within the industry. I expect if I file a VPP claim, they will deny that, as well. Most of my damaged property is unscheduled. I feel they should do due diligence and attend to this claim. You can stop reading if you get the gist of this. The rest are details. Yes, I am interested in filing a court action. Yes, if this can be settled by the state insurance commissioner, that would be easier and better. But I'm doubtful it will be successful. Yes, I am open and receptive to any and all suggestions. I am really in need of qualified guidance. Here are some details: A WEEK after placing my initial call to USAA, I received a call from someone from a construction company. They said they'd been contacted by USAA, and they'd send someone out. We set up a time, they said they'd bring a team. No team came. A fella showed up alone about an hour late, he was dispatched to the wrong address. I had corrected my address at least three times with USAA, but they never seem to actually correct my address. The fella said he didn't know what he was supposed to do. He said he'd never done anything like this before. He walked around, talked a lot about who knows what, and left. The next day, another guy called and said he was coming the following day. He was even worse. He took pictures, insulted me and my belongings, lied, and told me to lie about where water was coming in. He said I'd better not tell USAA that water came in from below the floor, or my claim would be denied. I explained water came in from above AND below. He never inspected the roof. He didn't even look at it. I offered to show him photos of the water coming in. He wouldn't look at the actual photos I have, of the water entering. It turns out, he wasn't even a licensed adjustor. He has no license of any kind registered in the state. Neither did the first guy. How does USAA decide which unqualified, untrained, unlicensed person they will dispatch to come and photograph my personal belongings and ask me personal questions? I have no idea. Before I had a chance to find out that the guy wasn't even licensed, I'd already heard from USAA, informing me that based on that knucklehead's so called report, they were denying my claim. I also learned that the first guy they sent out was also not licensed. I told USAA that he wasn't qualified, he didn't do anything; he lied to me about my policy, and told me to lie to USAA about where water was coming in, and I wanted them to know this! I told them from the get go, that if I file a claim, any claim - it will be ACCURATE. I don't care if it doesn't jive with their expectations. If they want to know how and where water is coming in, I will tell them what I saw. I will show them photos. I have witnesses. It happened more than once. If the source of water doesn't jive with their expectations or protocol or algorithm, that is a problem outside of my domain. I'm here to tell the truth. I have tried. For some reason, the property owner does not openly accept or admit that water came up from between the bricks. But her sons have seen it, and we discussed it when it first happened a couple of years earlier. Maybe something about building code violations? But should I be expected to cover for her if that is indeed the case? I don't think so. And yet USAA seems very happy and willing to fully accept all of the property owner's inaccurate and deceptive statements when it helps them to deny my claim. The property owner told USAA that water entered the residence because of leaves, based on the fact that the property owner refused to call a licensed contractor to come out and actually inspect or repair the premises, and instead called upon her elderly mother who lives locally, to find someone; and her elderly mother found an unlicensed, unbonded, unqualified, physically impaired, medically fragile person who calls himself a handyman. The fella came out and fiddled around, cleaned up the leaves, and said leaves on the roof caused the damage. He did some ""repairs"". The owner asked ServiceMaster to come out. They removed the walls and ceilings in the closet. The handyman returned a few weeks later to replace the walls and ceilings. But guess what. Water came pouring in again 2 weeks later when it rained, because the problem wasn't caused by leaves, and he never fixed the actual problem. Regardless, neither USAA nor the owner will budge from their totally inaccurate, made-up story that all of this damage was caused by leaves, despite the fact that no qualified person, no contractor or any individual has ever inspected the roof to assess and identify the source of damage. Last week, the same handyman replaced the skylight at the request of the owner, and reported that it was damaged and has holes in it. This is consistent with hail damage, and we did receive hail when all this happened. Yet, despite the fact that we know there was hail, high wind, and the skylight was damaged, for some reason, the owner sticks to her story that leaves caused the damage. And USAA is perfectly fine with this. It allows them to reject my claim and give me the runaround. The fact that there was no standing water when either of the fake adjustors showed up a week later than promised can be attributed to the fact that they showed up a week later than promised. It's not my fault that USAA reneged on their agreement to have someone come out in 24-48 hours. It seems USAA is working for the property owner, but I am USAA's customer, not the property owner. The property owner is a customer of MetLife. The property owner has not been honest with MetLife about the source of damage. Yet, USAA prefers to go with her story, despite the fact that she has never seen the damage, lives in a different state, and refused to comply with USAA's (and my) repeated requests to provide a report by a qualified contractor. I could say more, but this is long enough. I feel for the many people who have spent time and countless hours attempting to resolve their own issues with USAA. I feel badly for them. Many have served our country. They deserve to be treated better. My father-in-law led the Normandy invasion. He earned many medals and awards. He was a decorated Army officer. My father was a navigator in the Air Force, and flew night missions over Borneo. What does USAA do to honor their memory, their legacy? I realize that isn't their responsibility - it is ours. However, I have read so many stories by family members who are suffering because of USAA's negligence, and I didn't want my own situation to be left outside in the cold. If anything I can offer helps others stay out of this kind of situation, I'm willing to help. I proudly boasted of my allegiance to USAA for many years. Those days are over. They need to be called out for their deplorable practices. Too many people, and too many lives are at risk due to their lack of accountability. I am seeking other insurance, and hope there is some class action suit that can help others attain some measure of justice. I'm sorry this is so long. I hope the moderators of this site will feel comfortable editing my entry to make it shorter. Thank you.",1074

They said that I scheduled a payment with a tablet which I don't have. I always pay via the phone. Well they reverses all the overdraft charges but the account charge off still remained. Even if a payment was prompted if I was allowed to transfer money in my account this would have never happened. And to top it off the supervisor told me that after the payment was reverse that this would not affect me in any way. She then proceeded to tell me just open another checking account. She is a supervisor in banking and should have advised me to wait a few weeks before attempting to open a new checking account. She send me to open a new account and I was denied opening a checking account because of unfavorable business with a financial institution.

A USAA insured customer knocked my outside mirror completely off my vehicle. The insured left a note admitting fault and contact info for whatever I needed. I texted the insured and he immediately gave his USAA policy number to process the claim. Two days after the incident I took my vehicle to the approved auto body repair center for an estimate of damages as requested. It was a matter of two weeks before I spoke with the claims adjuster in which the claims adjuster stated that she had to speak with the insured regarding the situation. I was confused what further measures needed to be discussed as the insured admitted to being at fault. The insured decided to say that he felt the mirror was not stable and/or it may have been glued on. This is incorrect.  The auto body shop never determined that it was a faulty installation or questionable stability of the mirror. I have followed up for three weeks since the accident and the claims adjuster has yet to return a single call as I have requested. The adjusters manager hasn't returned a call either. A manager I did speak with said that all of the information would be relayed to the case manager, but as of now USAA would not be accepting responsibility. USAA determined that the mirror was glued on prior to it being knocked off! This is unacceptable. USAA could not have made that determination based on pictures, and I was with the vehicle during the estimate in which time the individual doing the estimate never made that determination. The insured individual felt that way and has no evidence supporting his belief. In what day and age can someone admit to making a mistake in black and white on paper, offer their insurance info and not be liable because they lied to their insurance carrier so their premium wouldn't go up , and get away with it. That's the kind of principles USAA stands by.  The fact that someone took responsibility for their actions and now do not need to because of a false claim that has no evidence behind it is wrong! They are screwing me out of money to fix my car. They will not return calls, they are not available to talk when you call no matter what time during business hours you call.

Rep comes out and gives me a folder saying it will explain the process yada yada yada. Now I just had a fire and everything that belongs to my deceased husband who had a service-connected death was inside of ruined. So to say my mind was not really there was enough but when I get around to reading what was inside, I was lost. All that was inside was two pages with my deductible info and a sheet for Auto Insurance. Nothing about the process for HO.  So first, they say I don't have personal property because I changed for lower rates with my auto. They basically said I no longer had personal property because those were together. I know for a fact when I purchased my home, I'd requested for my PP to be added into my HO because I have a multi-family. In the end, I was told in order to get any info on my PP, I'd have to get a subpoena for them to release the information. Just goes to show that they didn't want me to have the information on what I was covered for or not. I'm waiting months (3) before I even see a check for the fire and on top of that, Bank of America kept sending them back saying they're not written correct or they needed more info from USAA. I'm calling USAA to find out what's going on and finally get the checks sent correctly, fire was in August, didn't get checks until end of March. Now I'm dealing with BOA and their inspectors. Several times they sent out inspectors but they had to send out another because the one they sent didn't do something or were no longer working with them. Add on top of that the five to ten business days and time is flying past with little funds to get work done. So here it is, the house USAA placed us in, the lease is up and we're homeless because the work is just now starting. It's like splitting hairs to get the disbursements from BOA to keep the work going.  In the meantime, USAA drops my HO saying because the work's not finished. I can't get insured because the work's not complete and they still have my claim for my PP open but refuse to payout. I call USAA and they say my claim is still good and to continue the work. I get almost finished and BOA sells my loan, just great. New company says they don't have the funds so of course, I'm calling BOA and USAA. Can't reach USAA for months but I finally get new the company on the line with BOA and get the funds. But of course the funds are short - over $100,000 short. When I finally get in contact with my rep at USAA, he says he's no longer in that department but email him pictures of the work. I do and it takes him over a month just to tell me he can't open the pictures so I mail him a disk. I'm pissed because I feel like he's not working my claim and ask for info for the new Claims Manager but he never responds. Another month passes before he responds saying he needs to send out a USAA rep to view property. Then he takes vacation and I'm back in the dark about what's going on. I'm calling the number he's left on his VM but it's not in working order so I wait and continue to call him. When I finally reach him he says I need to send in receipts. Now this is my first claim, I've never even had an auto claim so I don't know the process and he only gave me info on Auto Claim in the packet he gave me. This is baffling because I was never told to keep all the receipts and the ones I had many of them were unreadable so I mail him everything I have. When USAA dropped my insurance, he never mentioned anything about the receipts then either. I'm emailing him to find out if he's received them and nothing, mailing letters, nothing. I've certified mailed my rep, Presidential Department, Claims Manager Supervisor, Claims Manager, any and everyone but still have not heard anything back. I've mailed them so many letters, it's beyond ridiculous. I finally contact the Missouri Department of Insurance and waiting again. I'm at the end of my ropes and still, I don't know what to do to get USAA to pay the claim besides wait. I think this is total bs when I've paid them, now they don't want to payout without me having to get a lawyer.

It's not common that I've had bad experiences, however, the bad ones really stuck with me. First, my car was totaled last year. The person at fault had an insurance company that was moving slow so I contacted USAA because I needed a rental ASAP so I could get back and forth to the doctor and chiropractor. They set up the rental and completed an appraisal quickly. Once that was done I get notified that I can only keep the rental for 7 days because that's what my policy says.  So I'm sitting there trying to understand the logic. The other insurance company provides a rental for 30 days on a total loss. Considering my police report indicated the other person was 100% at fault. I don't know why USAA, the people I pay every month, would not provide me with the same option. Each person I spoke with was insensitive to the situation disregarding the fact that I was just injured and losing a car that has a lien is not fun. My most recent incident occurred in December 2016. I was in an accident and when I filed my claim I also filed under my medical payments. This was my first time and what a horrific experience. Now I have medical insurance so I went to the doctor and of course they bill my insurance. I was not made aware that they shouldn't do this. The last time I was in an accident I was told to bill my insurance because it was required. USAA operates differently when it comes to medical payments. The person in charge of this portion of the claim randomly sent an email to me without contacting me first so I didn't know what this was. Then I attempted to call her on multiple occasions only to not receive a response until I complained to the company. Once she called me she told me that their process is not to file under my medical insurance.  At this point I made it clear to her that I work for a bank not an insurance company and had she contacted me in the beginning I would've known. So at this point I have no bills just EOB's.

My fiance received his pre-approval and the house hunt began! We were so happy. We found our dream home and made the offer. Next step was the actual approval which was a breeze. We did everything super speed and like clockwork, everything worked in our favor - appraisal, inspection, termite inspection, etc. Everything was done including our closing date being set. My fiance asked our processor if everything was a go and if we would have any problems. The processor told him that nothing would change as long as we didn't have any financial changes or any negative marks on his credit report.  We gave notice to our landlord, yay! We didn't hear from USAA for about a week. We called and called and emailed, messaged, and screamed!!!!! No answer. Finally our loan processor called to say that we were no longer approved. We needed more money in the bank, $4,000 to be exact. My fiance told them that he had money, but it was put away in a personal safe. They wanted a deposit to be made and to have a friend or family member write a letter stating it was a gift and wouldn't need to be repaid (what the what?). I've never heard of such garbage!!! We did this though. After all we want this home.  We called the next day to make sure everything is in order. Now they want more information that we have already sent to them. Again, we did this. The next day, they called to say that we needed another large sum of money in our account. AGAIN, we did this (I really feel sorry for those who don't have extra cash and funds available b/c these people are ridiculous!). They wanted detailed information from transactions $100+ and copies of checks. Whatever, we did it just so we can buy this home. Everything is a go, until we get yet another horrible phone call. We can't close for another two months!!! This is due to a company policy that we were unaware of. Because we are in the state of Alabama, there is right of redemption on the home. So, why weren't we told this in the beginning?  USAA received a contract from HUD. We have talked about it being a foreclosure with the processor on several occasions as well. My fiance has talked to our loan processor's supervisor, but nothing came out of it. We have lost thousands! We are fighting to keep our sales contract open as of now so we can obtain a loan through a different organization. I would like information if anyone has anything on class action lawsuits against the mortgage department. I think that this company is horrible. You care about military and their family? We have a week to find somewhere to live and it's not just the two of us; we have a small child. We are out earnest money, inspection money, pest inspection money, the cost for power and water for said inspections, money we paid USAA to lock in an interest rate (ONE THAT WE WON'T BE GETTING!), etc!!!! I hope that they sleep well at night knowing that they are messing with people. How would they feel if someone did these things to them or their family? It is going to be my life mission to make sure that our story is heard by as many people as possible. I am THAT hurt. I do NOT like liars, and I feel like that is what this company is about. Train your people to do a job and know the facts. I urge everyone to please reconsider business with this horrible company. Save yourselves the headache, runaround, and heart ache. They do not care about you or your family.",1096

I explained that we immediately went to the DMV and had it titled which had the date on it and was told that would suffice.  I emailed this to them and then heard nothing back. I had to make another phone call and after being told that yes, this was what they needed and the claim was approved, I was put on hold for 20 minutes because of a ""glitch"" getting the windshield repair claim set up. I then got an email saying that the title was not enough and I had to provide a bank statement or ATM receipt showing the withdrawal of the funds for the car.

I called, and they said I transferred the $125 to my other checking. But I said I don't have another checking, but she brought up my son's name and his account. As a solution, she suggested I close my bank account and open another. So, I let her open a new account, and I asked about my auto pay companies. She said the transactions would automatically transfer with the new account since it was closed.  But the same day right after the new account, they sent a transaction of my auto and property insurance. I auto pay to USAA, which they said caused the account to reopen itself, so all of my auto pay companies stayed directed to the closed but ""re-opened"" account getting only a returned NSF. So we're not paid, and USAA charged my closed ""re-opened"" account $363 in overdraft fees. At the end of the cycle, I noticed that $363 was charged to my new account in one lump sum called a ""posted debit."" I called, and they were adamant about reversing the fees as it wasn't a bank error but did afterwards without my knowledge added $116 back to the closed account which was still open. This all started June 23 or 26, and I'm still getting charges from I don't know.  Now, they are writing me letters about my cell phone company, which is charging me a fee for when they tried to get their money. But I paid them cash on the due date and still have the text messages from them saying they got my payment on due date. But days later, my phone shut down and I finally found out they wanted $15 of late fee to turn on my services.  And now, I got a letter in the mail from them saying I owe $40 for NSF at the bank because the account was closed when they tried to get their auto pay. But I went into the phone profile and updated my bank info. I can never get a person to talk to at the phone company. I paid my phone bill twice in person at Wal-Mart T-Mobile, my carrier, with no problem at all. So my bank just sent me a notification that they are going to charge me $15 for NSF that T-Mobile tried to get paid from the closed account on July 23. I've talked to everybody and to the top executive, who refused to let me hear the phone conversation where the rep said the auto pays would automatically go to the new bank account and that it wasn't a bank error. He also told me to write a message to the bank not to let T-Mobile collect from the old account. So, I don't know what to do. This bank keeps charging me, and it's September 6 at 4am. I guess I have to close that account after I reset all my auto pays up with the new account, plus I have low-cost insurance and roadside assistance and they are geared towards military families.  They also sent another e-check to this company from my son's account, which has had a 0 balance for months. But they sent it anyway, I guess, hoping to collect an overdraft fee but realized this time they couldn't get it from my account unless they did. And that's what the $29 fee is for that I can't figure out, or it could be T-Mobile. I need some help in getting my money back from the bank, because it is wrong what they are doing and they have never done it before.

I had been stopped at a red light waiting to turn left with my blinker on, when the light turned green. I was waiting for cross traffic to pass to make my turn when the driver of the other car (a Bronco) decided talking to her passenger was more important than paying attention to the road. She ran into the back hatch and bumper of my 2003 Kia Sedona. The bumper was cut up, the hatch was bent in by about 8-10 inches and would no way open ever again and the rear light was cracked, among a few other things. Witnesses, including a fireman (who was driving by, he was the one I was waiting for so I could make my turn), saw the whole thing and contacted dispatch himself. Police was on the scene in about 3 minutes and took the report. All witnesses (including her and her passenger) said the same thing - she was the one at fault and the officer in his report claimed the accident was due to her ""inattention.""  I got home and called USAA right away and advised them of what happened. And then, the runaround began. First, they said they hadn't been able to ""contact"" their insured and it ""wouldn't be fair to her"" if they went ahead and took responsibility for the accident. Well, my husband took it upon himself to call the driver and ask her himself, and lo and behold, her boyfriend/hubby said ""no one"" from the insurance company had ""ever"" tried to contact them to date. He even told my husband that as soon as he got off the phone with him, he was going to call USAA and tell them that ""Yes, the accident was their fault."" One of the reps from the company came out this morning and took 2 whole pictures of the damage. I had already been to a local repair shop and had estimates ready at just over $3,000.00. He briefly looked at it, took a few more notes and promised me he would get his report to them asap. (I tend to believe him since I don't think he actually works for USAA, just contracts out.) After several attempts to talk to our adjuster, LaRhonda ** (whom I have yet to speak to - go figure), we have been tossed around by the USAA ** ""TEAM"", whose sole mission I believe was to have me claim on my insurance, let me be out the deductible plus rental expense for a van, and then let GEICO try and get the money back for me. Ain't gonna happen. My husband is furious (he is a river boat pilot) and it frustrates him that he can't be at home right now to take care of the situation. Luckily, the boat right now is in an area where he has excellent cell phone coverage. =) I have already gotten a copy of the police report, and faxed it to USAA. (Basically we have done all the work for them). The report also clearly shows that the other driver was at fault. After I told my husband that the information was faxed and he had indeed contacted the other party, he then called USAA and advised them of a simple fact: if he had to miss his vacation, (the first one as a family in over 10 years), Katy bar the door, every dime we have saved for this vacation was going into hiring an attorney and was going to get them for all he could. And if he had to be home at all for any reason because of this fiasco, he was going to add an additional $400.00 a day (which is his daily pay), not to mention the fact we have just filed a complaint with the Kentucky Department of Insurance over this deal. (The whole lying about trying to get a hold of the party at fault just rubbed us the wrong way). At this point, I can't open the back of my van and it makes it hard to shop for groceries for 4 kids when I can't get anything back there, not to mention the fact that I have 2 boys playing baseball at this time. Wish me luck in getting bat bags, catchers gear, water coolers etc., in a van with no way of access to get in the back. We have a vacation in 2 weeks coming up. Again, it is kind of hard to fit suitcases into a small smashed area. The repair shop is busy and will be unable to even get to my van for 10-15 days, which means that if we are going to actually go on vacation, I will have to either try to wait USAA out, pay for rental van (at least $75.00 a day for a van) or pay out-of-pocket a deductible of $500.00 to get my van working again and it still may not be ready for our vacation. I have come to the conclusion that insurance companies really need to be held responsible. Wish us luck!",1100

I have received large checks from these individuals and have always deposited online since we are not near a branch. There was never an issue. Ever. Until... Our payroll company made a mistake and my check was not direct deposited. My company issued me a check and I deposited it as usual. Then I saw they had put a hold on most of it. It happened to be at a time when I was using those funds to go out of town. I called to explain the situation and was told that they have the right to hold any check at their discretion. I was treated worse than I have ever been treated by a business.  The ""supervisor"" asked me what I wanted it for. I told him it was none of his business. He told me I could take out a loan. I told him I did not need a loan just my own money. We were mysteriously disconnected. I called back three times and each time I argued I was disconnected. So... today I deposited my tax refund check. They held the majority of it. I again called and was told by a very mouthy customer service rep that their computer system scans our accounts and it determines the hold. I told her to give me the ""supervisor"" and not to disconnect me. She did and he began saying that all checks have holds on them. I assured him that is untrue and asked him to look at my deposits. He said he has the right to decide if he should hold by the amount I have in my account.  I asked if he had ever served in the Military. He cleared his throat and said no. I asked how much he had in his account. He said he does not have to tell me that. I said ""EXACTLY!"". I asked if I had ever in all the years had a check not clear. He said ""No but it could happen to this one"". I informed him he might win the lottery, drive his car up a tree, get stranded in a snow storm. That is ridiculous. I then told him they need to stop saying they are a Military bank, His response was that they definitely are not. I asked ""Why do you advertise that you are when you are obviously no different than any other bank that gives discounts for Military"". He said they are not doing anything wrong. I said ""It is shady at best and you treat customers horribly and much worse than any bank I have ever been to"".  I also told him ""I realize a lot of it has to do with the bravado of knowing you do not have to speak face to face with the customer you are berating"".

We filed under our insurance, USAA, with the understanding they would subrogate. Originally, the car was found repairable. On Monday, April 10th, it was determined to be a total loss. We were told when we originally filed our claim if it was declared a total loss we would receive 20% of the cash value to purchase a new vehicle. USAA is now claiming they are required to send the 20% benefit I have under my policy for car replacement assistance to the lien holder, Suntrust. No one at USAA has been able to show me where my policy or law requires this, as they admitted it is an ""internal policy"" and contradicts their original statement when I filed the claim (and my coverage documents). USAA has sent a total settlement letter to the lien holder, Suntrust, for the amount of $33,034.86. They valued my car at $27,521.66. However, they are including the car replacement amount ($5,513.20) in the total settlement to Suntrust. Even with the $33,034.86 Suntrust will not be made whole and my gap insurance will have to pick up the remaining amount. In order for me to receive the car replace assistance funds, USAA now wants Suntrust to provide, in writing, that they will not require USAA to send them the $5513.20. The problem is they have not provided Suntrust with a breakdown of the settlement, additionally it is not Suntrust's position to tell an insurance company how to disburse their funds. I think USAA knows this and that is why they are making it as if Suntrust requires this. My concern is this is a subrogation case and if USAA were to give me the $5513.20 they would not be able to recoup the funds from the other insurance company. Therefore, since they are obligated to pay the car replacement assistance under the policy they have chosen to pay it to the lien holder under the ""total settlement"" and will subrogate it.",1103

In the past year, the following has occurred: Internet account has been hacked multiple times and personal data is repeatedly corrupted so that I cannot access my account by internet and I am unable to verify my identity when contacting them by phone. Fraudulent credit card charges have been made on my accounts exceeding $40,000. These were done from a foreign location on a daily basis for several days in a row without setting off any alarms even though the cards had been dormant for months. (It is worth noting that given a similar set of circumstances AMEX would have sounded a loud alarm immediately.) Wire transfers from my bank accounts were arranged by telephone and sent to a foreign location. Both my savings and checking accounts were completely drained and grossly overdrawn. To add insult and additional injury, the USAA portal was used to transfer $60,000 from my accounts at another bank to USAA so that the perpetrators could continue getting rich on USAA incompetence. The other bank accounts had been registered with USAA as an alternate means of paying insurance premiums. Attempts to contact USAA by telephone and resolve the matter have been fruitless. After jumping through several hoops to verify my identification on several occasions over the past TWO MONTHS, I am always told that a supervisory fraud specialist will call me within 48 hours. No one has ever called. As it stands I am stuck with no access to the money I had in my accounts, no way to resolve the credit card fraud, and no way to straighten out the damage that has been done to my credit rating. USAA is entirely unresponsive. I would strongly urge anyone who has accounts with USAA to google USAA credit card fraud and read all of the horror stories that pop up; then find another bank and close everything with USAA before you become a victim of their highly porous security system and nonexistent customer service.

My girlfriend was stopped at the end of our street waiting for oncoming traffic to clear before turning down the street. While waiting to turn, a Ford Ranger pick-up came down the street at an estimated 50 mph when it failed to touch the brakes and struck the rear of the Nissan. All parties transported to the hospital, both vehicles totaled. My girlfriend is an authorized operator of the Nissan. The vehicle was properly registered and inspected and all equipment as in working order. The accident was witnessed by an off-duty state trooper.  The accident was deemed no fault of ours and the third party operator was identified and is licensed in Massachusetts and insured by Commerce. About the vehicle that we have insured with USAA, it was a 2010 Nissan Pathfinder 4x4, SE model that was meticulously maintained as I have all receipts for work completed on the vehicle. At the time of the accident it had 63,139 miles, and only 4 payments left. It has now been totaled. I opened a claim with USAA the day the accident occurred and rented a 2015 Nissan Pathfinder that was $5.00 dollars a day more than my allotted $30.00 a day coverage. Didn't think it would matter much because I am under the impression that I am entitled to like transportation for a no fault accident. When I show up to rent the vehicle they refused to rent to me unless I was willing to stipulate that I would pay a $150.00 detail fee since I have dogs that I transport to day care a couple days a week and the German Shepherd goes with me everywhere, which was why I had a Pathfinder in the first place. They have refused to pay the difference, detail fee and taxes on the vehicle, and have advised they will no longer pay for the rental effective 4/24/15, even though we haven't come to a settlement claim. Running out of characters so to shorten it up, I have spoken to **, all total claim lost representatives. I received a little help from ** and no help from the other two. I requested to speak to a supervisor from ** and she said she would have one contact me. They never did. I asked for a supervisor's extension since one hadn't called me back from **. She refused to give me the extension, put me through to the voice mail, and I haven't heard back supervisor **. Some of the issues that I have is that my vehicle was undervalued, despite having all the receipts for any and all work done on the vehicle. In the last 15 months I spent over 2300 maintaining the vehicle. Even in the 17 page report the N.A.D.A stated my vehicle was valued at $19,575. When I confronted ** with that fact she stated they don't use N.A.D.A which is the insurance bible for vehicle valuations. I told her it was on page 17 and she was still saying they don't use it, but it was in the report they had generated via a third party appraiser to determine the value of my vehicle. That is a $1,145 dollar discrepancy, so they were also short charging me on the vehicle sales tax, which on a $1,145 difference would be $71.56 for a total of $1216.56. They have refused to pay for the full tank of gas that was put in just before the accident, despite the vehicle appraiser taking a photo of the gauge to show it was full. I am still fighting them for the monies that I am out of pocket for a no fault accident and have come to the conclusion that I will be seeking legal remedies to be made whole. They told me to seek remedies against the opposing insurance company. I explained to them, that was why I paid USAA, so USAA would have my back and be my representative for this matter. It went nowhere. I am disgusted that a company that purports to have the best interest for veterans, which I am, and their families at heart, was unwilling to fight to get me what I was entitled to.  It's bad enough that I am now going to have to have auto payment for a couple years as opposed to driving a vehicle that I had every intention of driving for the next 6-8 years. Now I have a legal fight on my hand because USAA failed to represent my best interest, when I finally needed an insurance company to fight for me. Truly disgusted and will now be insuring my vehicle with GEICO. Saved $170.00 on a yearly policy with slightly higher limits than what I had with USAA.

I have car and renter's insurance with them. I moved into my apartment in March 2016. My apartment has flooded about 5-6 times since I've lived here. After hurricane Matthew which I had personal items damaged my apartment got flooded at least another 3 times. Two of which my television and stereo system was shorted out and some other things. I of course made my claim with USAA on November 25th or so for my television and stereo system. I heard nothing except one representative would tell me one person was working on my claim then another person said ""oh no it's this person.""  Flash forward. Mind you my claim never got settled. December 30th, it flooded again... My television shorted out again. I made a claim. They called my apartment complex manager who of course to cover her own but said ""oh I only know of the one time."" Again my representative says it's another representative I have to talk to until now it's January 2017 and now a special investigator unit is handling my claim. Not only did one female representative talk to me so gruffly I thought I had done something wrong. But the special investigator comes out and grills me about my situations. Asked where I worked. Asked twice when I started working there. Now mind you I've had pneumonia and severe bronchitis for over a month and been on all kinds of medicine and been running really high fevers. But even now today January 7th 2017 I go to go into my app for the insurance website and of course I'm blocked from seeing my claims.  On top of that I go to the online website try to look at my claims and of course I get to wondering... Do they think I'm defrauding them?? So of course the curious over-thinker I am I click on insurance fraud on the website to make sure I haven't overstepped any boundaries. All I can think is this special investigator kept asking me if he pulled up my phone records would it show I called the office or this person or that person. So of course now my anxiety is running high because now I'm thinking “oh my gosh what if he's hacking into my phone?” Because now I can't go on the insurance app... and I'm of course freaking out.  Well now I'm really upset! This apartment complex manager knew my apartment flooded every time it rained and only chose to put in the system I called once or twice... I have black mold around my windows from the water. And half the time I just yelled out to a passing maintenance team member and they would come with their steam cleaner vacuum to remove the water. I'm so upset I've been a member of USAA for so long and I'm looked at as a criminal!! How dare you turn a bad situation where I am getting messed over by the apartment complex and turn it on me!!

I told the buyer that I would refund the difference but the nearest TD Bank was over an hour away. The buyer said that his wife had a BoA (nearest branch less than 15 minutes away) account and that I could deposit the over payment in her account. Knowing that there are scammers out there, I called USAA to ensure that the check from the TD bank had cleared. I specifically told the representative from USAA all the details of this transaction and that I did not want to find out that his TD Bank check bounced after I had deposited the refund into his account. I was assured that all funds were available and the check was ""good."" Based on the information from USAA, I deposited the over payment into the buyers account. Two days later, guess what?

When the dealer began the work, more damage was noticed. The dealer was consulted; the engine would need to be replaced, therefore total loss. Miscommunication between body shop and USAA delayed the process for a week. I expressed my concern that due to this delay I'm likely to have to make another car payment. I'm told that any car payments I make after the date, it is declared a loss and will be reimbursed to me. The Total Loss Department took its time figuring out the value, and when they did, they didn't bother to let me know. When I called to follow up after a couple of weeks I got the valuation, I noticed that several features were not checked even though those features were standard for that model. Supposed lack of those features was used as a rationale to determine a lower value. In the meantime, I was told that I don't have gap insurance, so of course I'm concerned about the crappy valuation on my car, which was only two months old. I expressed my concern that another car payment will be due in a couple of weeks. I don't have a car and my 30 days of rental car coverage is about to run out, but I'm still on the hook for car payments. On January 10th, a woman in Total Loss tried to pressure me to release the car so it can be hauled off to a junk yard, and they can cut a check for the value. I told her that I still need to get some things out of it, including the sticker so that I can prove what options and features it had. I went and got my personal items, the sticker and release the car. I faxed the information to USAA. My understanding is that they will pay based on their valuation and then they will adjust it later if the value is determined to be different. On January 11th, I was told that actually I do have total loss coverage and not to worry because whatever payments I make after the date of loss will be reimbursed to me. ""After the date of loss,"" I asked to confirm, ""or after the date it is declared a loss?"" ""After the date of the loss, the date of the accident,"" the representative said. On January 17th, I got a letter dated January 10th saying, ""Sorry, we could not agree on the car's value."" I've just made another car payment (due on the 15th). I called to find out whether they got the information I faxed. They say they did get it, ""It is now under review."" They tell me that the payment has not been made and won't be made until I sign a Power of Attorney. I had been told that all I had to do was ""release"" it by telling the body shop that it was released, which I had done already.  Later they try to blame the delay on the POA, but actually I was not notified that the POA would hold up the process for payment. I had clearly been told that ""as soon as I released the car, payment would be made."" Furthermore, the POA was not requested of me in time to have that done and get it there before the next car payment at any rate. Again, I was told more than once that I would be reimbursed for payments made after the date of loss (by one person) or after the date it was declared a loss (by someone else).

I noted that the pick-up truck behind me was almost hitting me over and over, having trouble stopping. So Itried to get out of his lane, but no one would let me into another lane. Then it happened, he hit me from behind! I stopped and got out, but I was dizzy. I got a notebook and a pen and took notes. As we waited for the policeman to come, I saw that the man had to lean on the truck to stand up straight. Clearly, he was DRUNK. And he told me he was going to a Maryland Terrapins game in a company truck, why not in his own vehicle? 3 IMPORTANT THINGS NEED TO BE NOTED; 1) The man was drunk and the policeman never checked him, as I asked him to. 2) What was the construction company who let him use their vehicle? 3) Important to note... In the conversation between the policeman, who knew about the company and asked ""the drunk"" about his boss and his company, a big one in Maryland.  After the drunk was let go to go to the game, I got in my car and went home. I had no health insurance and drove home at 35 miles an hour, went to an emergency clinic to learn that I had a severe concussion and needed to take it easy.

I did not want to drive until I was better, however I should have been offered a rental by USAA. I was still foggy and did not notice and therefore didn't ask for one. The fog lasted almost 3 months. When I sent in accident information to USAA, I saw that I could not read and understand my notes from that day. They looked like gibberish and were unreadable, with words meandering all over the page. It seemed funny, but it was sad. THEY OFFERED ME... WAIT FOR IT... $297. I was STUNNED AND CALLED USAA. No matter how many times I called and spoke to different ""higher officials"", no one understood my problem of a settlement of $297 and $7000, my lower figure. (The seminar is $750, per person and I turned down over 8 people.) I lost track of the count, since I knew I could not handle large classes. I do what I can to serve all of my students well, being clear that I want ALL of my students to be able to read and use the PhotoReading system for the rest of their learning and business lives. My pledge to them is that they can be an excellent PhotoReader and I have not lost a student yet in my 26 years of teaching. My insurance company, USAA, CANNOT BOAST ANYTHING NEAR THAT SERVICE. In retrospect, if I were the wiser person I am today, I would have sued the construction company for BIG money. I live and learn. Thank you for reading this.",1139

I sold my condo in October, 2016 and put all of my furniture and items in storage for 4 months. When I sold my condo I contacted USAA and explained my items would be in storage until I bought and renovated the place I was buying. On November 8th, 2016 I bought a townhouse. I contacted USAA for homeowners insurance but also told them my furniture and personal belongings would be in storage indefinitely. The moving company required that everything in storage be covered by insurance. I trusted that USAA had provided me with the correct insurance to cover both my townhouse but my items in storage. On February 1st, 2017 I physically had my items from storage moved to my new residence. Unfortunately there were a number of items broken and not delivered. The moving company had 120 days per their contract to find my items. Unfortunately after 60 days they sent me a check for $132.00 at 60 cents a pound for the items packed and broken by them. I was advised to contact my insurance carrier as the items were not found. When I contacted USAA I was told by several individuals that my renters insurance was cancelled when I purchased my homeowners insurance and since they only keep messages for 90 days they had no record of what my phone call consisted of and therefore they would not reimburse me for the items that were not delivered. I was very disappointed in the way this was handled. Their decision to pay nothing was based on their inability to have my phone call tape available.

You will get much faster results if you will simply contact the insurance commissioner or department of insurance in your state. Please believe me. This is much more effective than hiring a lawyer. Insurance companies hate to get turned in to the insurance commissioner. It costs several $100 to handle each complaint, it is free, most states have toll-free phone numbers, and in some states I believe you can file your complaint over the phone. Sometimes simply the threat of contacting the insurance commissioner or department of insurance is enough to get your problem solved. It also gives the state an accurate picture of how insurance companies are performing. I promise you that if your complaint is legitimate, you will get satisfaction. You can also help weed out lousy adjusters and rude employees.  I can tell you from experience that at USAA, top priority is given to complaints that have been turned in to the commissioner or department of insurance. Your file goes to the top of the stack on a manager's desk, gets top priority, and there are severe consequences against the company if the company does not respond by the end of a very strict deadline set by the department of insurance in your state.

I called them immediately the next morning and was told to email the crash report, which I did immediately and asked about a rental since I'm in sales I needed transportation. He said they'd need that to set up the rental. This was Friday morning at 9 am, didn't hear back of course.  Sunday late afternoon, I had to rent a car out of my pocket. Called Monday, no return call. Tuesday then I received an email that simply said the adjusters name and claim #. Called Wednesday, and finally another adjuster called me back, and said why didn't I report the claim to my insurance company? I told him I had, but they said, ""It's not your fault they need to do the estimate,"" and additionally, the state trooper had told me to call her insurance company. His reply was that they both gave me bad information and that there was a problem as the insured only had 10000.00 in coverage and I had a BMW so it wouldn't cover the claim! I said, ""You haven't looked at the car yet! It's at BMW in Sarasota. Go look at it."" Quite honestly, I'm not a mechanic, but I would estimate the damage at maybe 6000.00. He wouldn't pay for the rental, then he said they might be able to.  Then he put me on hold and said he called Sarasota BMW and they didn't have my car, and I might want to call law enforcement.

Keep in mind that I still have TWO cars insured by USAA. The problem (she says) is that one is registered in TN and one in MA, so USAA puts them on TWO DIFFERENT POLICIES. I reminded her that USAA serves military personnel who often have cars registered in multiple states, but she said there was nothing she could do about it. She offered to let me speak to a manager.

It is an exclusion in most policies if ""improper installation- some of the nails in the wrong place"", so they use that to deny your claim. Expert roofers supercertified by the material supplier will sell you a lifetime installation warranty for about $600 if everything meets the suppliers criteria, hold on to it. I have gone to watch some roofers and the little guys on the roof are not that consistent in how they drive the nails, that is the insurance company out. My parents were 60 year USAA members and paid premiums on the house for 40 years. My mother died and a month later we had a terrible wind/hail storm that damaged the roof and took down telephone poles and power out for days. We file a claim for my mothers estate. My sister has USAA also and they fixed her a new roof no problem. The same roofer says mom's roof is much worse. USAA hires a third party company out of Atlanta who says the roof is not damaged. We disagree and hire a public adjuster and request a second adjuster so USAA forks out for an Engineer who meets with our public adjuster and the engineer makes a report that a certain number of nails are out of place and therefore improper installation and the claim is denied. I have called several public adjusters and gotten similar answers. It is a new scam by many Insurance Companies to get out of paying roof claims.  If you want to pick an auto insurance company go to 8 different collision centers and ask how the various insurance companies fix the customers cars. If you want a homeowners policy call five or six public adjusters who get complaints from consumers and see what companies are reasonably honest. The interesting thing was that they had the least amount of complaints, ie no claims against Texas Farm Bureau. I am a 44 year member of USAA and I don't want this to happen to me or my children so I am in the process of looking elsewhere. USAA has changed. Even the life insurance ripped off the members about 2005.When I retired from the Air Force in 1990, I bought a usaa life policy instead of VGLI because USAA also had a decreasing tail benefit at the level premium after the 30 years was up all the way to 90 like the VGLI. It was the series three policy. This meant you could continue level premium after the 30 year policy and the benefit would drop all the way to 90 or 100 I have forgotten which. USAA decided that was not a good deal and initiated series five policies around 2004 and said at the end of the policy term not only would the benefit drop but the premium would go up and was shown to really go up to unaffordable levels unless by some chance you were going to die in a year or two and it was worth it to keep paying the double or triple premium for a year or two.

After over 10 days of trying to make contact with the other party and their USAA Insurance Company, the other driver finally took full responsibility and liability for the accident. USAA Insurance sent an auto adjuster to inspect my car for damages at a collision repair yard and declared my car a total loss. From day one, the following events took well over a month and are still ongoing. I was offered a settlement amount that was for a different zip code. After clearing that up, I received a different offer amount which was significantly less than cars at Southern California Dealerships with similar mileage, options and condition for the exact car I own.  I have evidence, documentation and photos, including the very document provided by the USAA adjuster that showed my vehicle except for a minor windshield crack defect was, as they stated, in good condition. This is not so. My car with low mileage of 38 thousand was in excellent condition, no body damage, no dents, no scratches, no tears in the interior fabric, no stains, no defects in the exterior paint, no blemishes, no paint fading, no need for repairs of any kind. All regular and recurring things such as oil changes and the like were performed on schedule and the photos I have of my car at the yard, even in its crashed condition, bear that out. That said, the USAA adjuster used the lower end of Internet Dealership evaluations for determining my car’s value. In my research of the Southern California dealerships, I found over 20 dealerships that with similar options, make and model and mileage, that had a minimum of $2,000 more in value than what was offered to me. Cars evaluated at the payout amount that was offered me had over 20 thousand more miles. I doubt the original mission of USAA created by 25 Army officers long ago as so stated to being committed to serving the military and veterans who have honorably served and their families would be pleased in how the company conducts business today. Treatment of people by over 200 other complainants on the consumer affairs website is self evident in their experiences, many complaints by veterans. I challenge the current Chairman and Chief Executive Offices or Board of Directors to review my complaint and continue to tell me they are beyond reproach that they can treat anyone indiscriminately with a take it or leave attitude without measures of accountability and equitable resolve. My dad, a passenger in the accident, is a United States Army Veteran of war and after this experience stated he would never do business with such a company. Shame on USAA of today, you are disgracing your founding fathers’ vision conducting business in self-satisfying interests without full consideration of the merits of the incident regardless if the claimant is not a customer. I have no fault in this accident. What I had was a great car paid in full in excellent condition with low mileage. To be treated with disregard unjustly is just wrong simply because we can attitude. USAA Auto Insurance as all insurance companies has an ethical and fiduciary responsibility as an insurance company to represent a case for its own merits. Based on other current online complaints for a variety of issues, a clear pattern exists with USAA lacking in the code of conduct for honesty, integrity and fairness. Maintaining the code of conduct must be a never-ending process to ensure good business practices.  In dealing with USAA, I am made to feel that if I don’t accept their offer, any charges the yard has, where my vehicle is, will be charged to me. In addition, I am given three days to accept and the auto rental vehicle charges will revert to me as well. I informed them I did not accept their offer but they could pick up the wrecked car since I was made to feel I would be responsible for storage. Two thousand dollars difference is an overwhelming burden and an amount I simply cannot make up the difference in order to have a similar car of equal value. I am a student working full time and the difference in car value I cannot make up, the stress and unfairness is completely unwarranted. By not accepting their offer I would have to rent a vehicle until the matter is settled, which could be a considerable amount of time. I attempted to resolve my concerns with USAA Insurance to no avail; they simply re-issued their original settlement without any explanation. I wouldn’t mind going on national television on a Judge show so that all others can see how this company does business. My father, a passenger in the accident, states, “I urge all Veterans and the public to think carefully about doing business with this company. Veterans and families please use extreme caution and care to avoid potential problems or dangers associated with this company when choosing to subscribe or maintain customer relations. I sincerely hope you do not have unfortunate circumstances to deal with this company in any like manner.” Likewise I will contact the California State Department of Insurance, the Federal Trade Commission, my California State and Federal Legislators and other Government Consumer Protection avenues at the highest levels in order to resolve this matter in a fair and just manner as well as inform ALL Veteran Communities.",1186

We created a list of items and tools stolen and submitted the pages to through the USAA mobile app. Sydney said that we need to come up with pictures and receipts to help her but if we didn't she would have to give us a estimated value. We have the premium policy with full replacement. When the repair and personal property was estimated by Sydney and USAA they authorized a fraction of the cost and replacement. She wanted me to use the USAA contractor call ""Teddy Bear Construction"", I refused. We wanted a contractor we knew with his work. So when we asked for her itemized list on our personal property she had only paid us for page 1 of our 4 pages of stolen items. Some of the tools stolen she itemized weren't even the same tools we listed that were stolen and she undervalues them by hundreds of dollars. So now that we called her on the discrepancies and 3 pages of items not figured in. We have been advised that they stopped payment on the check they sent out and have now hired a private investigator from Veracity Research out of TX to investigate us and our claim.

Employees were eager to help and despite the fact that it was mainly an online bank, it functioned as well as a brick-and-mortar bank. However, in my experience for the last several years the bank has steadily gone downhill. So much so that it has turned into my full-time job to monitor my accounts closely, particularly credit card statements, to ensure that they are accurate. Unfortunately, over the last couple of years I have had many instances of fraud on my credit cards, first on one card and then on both, for the same charges. And the fraud charges continued for several months. I don't understand how those charges are approved. Does not USAA have in place a system to account for the possibility of fraud and use it regularly? When I try to use the card, I am asked to prove who I am. When thieves use it (without the card itself), apparently, they have no problem. In addition, USAA does not seem to keep track of credit cards it issues. I was sent several credit cards (and new accounts created) when I only asked for a replacement card. Balances appeared on cards I never asked for. Initially, USAA refused to close the cards, thus facilitating the fraud. And the longer the fraudulent charges continued, of course, the more difficult it became to deal with them. I was reported to the credit bureau for going over my limit on one card, although the charge was fraudulent. And that card was one on which I asked for a low limit specifically to decrease the dollar amount of fraud in case the card was used fraudulently. Because the fraudulent charges continued for quite a few months, it became increasingly difficult to deal with them. I finally resorted to printing all credit card statements with fraudulent charges on them, indicating those fraudulent charges, mailing copies to USAA, and asking for credit for them as well as to close the accounts. I pointed out to USAA that I paid one fraudulent charge because USAA reported me to the credit bureau even though the charge was fraudulent. I told that to USAA and asked for my money back, but I am still waiting for all the credits to be issued. I won't hold my breath. As I said, USAA is unresponsive to customers in my experience. Dealing with all the fraudulent charges turned into a bookkeeping nightmare, which was not helped by the underlying feeling that these accounts could or would be hacked again and no one at USAA seemed to care. I did get new accounts (but no cards) but the old accounts were not closed, so I ended up with two or three statements for each card with fraud on each one. The feeling of vulnerability that resulted from all these fraudulent charges on all cards (some I never received, as I previously indicated) for so many months inspired me to never use USAA credit cards again. I told USAA I paid for fraudulent charges, indicated the ones for which I paid, and asked for a refund. USAA still owes me money for fraudulent charges I paid just to keep USAA from reporting me erroneously to the credit bureau as they had done before. I doubt I will ever see the refunds.  The bank doesn't seem to adhere to standard banking and accounting practices. It is though a group of trainees took over the bank and are trying to learn as they go. Something is askew at the bank, which does not bode well for customers with problems. As I read over this submission, the obvious question is: Why didn't I close the accounts at the first incident of fraud? I tried. I contacted USAA in writing and on the telephone many times about the fraudulent charges with a request for new cards. As a matter of fact, when customers call into USAA they are treated to a recording of ""USAA members can rest assured that they will not be held responsible for fraud on any account."" Not true. Also, I have been with USAA for a long time and aways paid on time, etc., and thought USAA would take that into account and quickly fix the problem. No such luck.

On November 20, 2012, around 3:45PM, I was going west on a 2-lane road headed to a gas station. This gas station's entrance is right next to an off ramp that when turning right, separates from the left turn and the lane going straight, seeming as if entering a freeway having to merge with the right lane. This was not the freeway. It was a 35mph street, really close to the university I attend. I've been living there for about 2 years and I know where this gas station is and I know what lane to be on (the guy who hit me lives in Arizona). I was turning right with my turn signal on as I was on the right lane trying to enter the station. As the tip of my car was entering the station, I was hit by a USAA member going onto the lane I was in from the off ramp.  The two doors on the right side of my Mitsubishi Outlander were hit and and the back right door is nearly popping off the car. He also messed up the inside where the passenger seat belt is. Both doors have to be replaced but fortunately, it still drives. The only bad part is all the people that I carpool with to school have to climb over to sit in the front since only my door and the back left door open. Not to mention that whenever I drive, you can hear air swooshing inside and it's loud. His car only has a dent by the left tire. We both parked into the station and I got out the car and asked him what had happened. He said that I went right in front of him and cut him off. I was in shock. I explained to him that I had green and I had the right of way and he had a yield that was obviously posted there. He didn't yield and that was the cause of the accident.  After I explained that to him, he shut up and we did what we had to do next. I called the police but they were of no help. All they said was that if no one is hurt, they did not have to send police and just to exchange insurance information. We did and I proceeded onto the next step in calling his insurance. They were really friendly and the claim representative that I got, Amanda **, made it seem like she agreed that it was his fault. She said that when the investigation is done, she would get back to me to start the repairs process. The next day, I received an email from her acknowledging my claim. About four days later, I still heard nothing and so I called them back. I got another representative named Tammy. She gave me instructions to take pictures of the scene. I did and sent them right away. Also, she sent me to one of their repairs shop, City Body and Frame, to get an estimate.  I got there and they seemed to be helpful. Anthony, the guy in charge of sending USAA pictures and the estimate of my car, said that it seemed like it was definitely the other guy's fault. He also said that they were going to start repairing it immediately since the door was popped out. He told me to wait as they got all the paperwork with USAA done. They came back with good news and said everything was approved, and that I should be picked up by an Enterprise employee to get a rental. I was surprised as how easy and fast it was. Problems with USAA started there. I got picked up and Enterprise was sorry to say that they could not sign me a rental because I only have liability and I'm under 21. I'm upset at this point because I have no car. Never was this mentioned by USAA. They knew my age and they knew I only had liability. The manager at Enterprise told me to call USAA and ask how much it would cost for me to have a rental just in case. I called them and I gave the representative my claim number. He gave me an attitude and told me he did not even know why I was there getting a rental because they had not yet approved anything. What? I was confused and frustrated because Anthony said everything had been approved. I immediately went back to claim my car before they started on it and would charge me for it. At this point, I'm mad at this body shop for lying but maybe after reading all these bad reviews on USAA, maybe they lied just to see how long I would last and hopefully forget about it. I told my dad what happened and he of course was mad. Not only are they taking too long, but either the body shop was lying or USAA was. He called Amanda's extension, but she never answered (she never does, but also turns out she was on vacation). Days later we called the main line again and talked to someone new. They made an appointment for another estimate elsewhere. They took about an hour, but the estimate was $3,700 - replace both doors, the inside and paint. On December 17, my dad called me saying that USAA has denied my claim. They are money-hungry, cheap and **. Their explanation was that there was a difference of opinion and their client Master Chief, whatever the hell, said I made a crazy turn from the left lane onto the gas station as he thought I was going to go straight on the left lane. So they spent all this time investigating but end up denying my claim because their customer said I was on the left lane.  They also said they have to back up their clients and that is why I was denied. Are you serious right now? We were more than infuriated. My dad called the man who hit me to tell him to be a man since he's supposedly this big shot military man that's supposed to be honorable and yada yada yada. He stuck to his ** story and and said that I was on the left lane and that's how it ended. I called my insurance company. They said that USAA already made their claim on Friday. ** again! They took weeks to investigate a yield sign, but immediately called my insurance to shift the blame on me. We didn't get this news until that following Monday morning. Common sense. No crap, this guy's lying. He never mentioned the left lane story to me when we were at the gas station. He had a yield and I had the right of way. I had no fault and he was to blame. It would have been smarter for him to lie about me not using my turn signal, but the man went out of the box to lie about something as ridiculous as his driving. My dad called the city to see if they had cameras there but unfortunately, they didn't. How can I prove that he's lying at this point? I then remembered the Mobil employee running to us, telling us to move up from the entrance. I went to give him a visit and I asked if they had cameras. They did but not ones that reach that far. He remembered me and asked if I was the person in the accident weeks prior. My eyes grew big and I knew I had a witness. Two actually who both told me they saw everything and it was clearly this man's fault. Let's see how USAA responds to this news. I did not think I would need a witness because it was obvious and it's common sense that he was at fault. Who knew this military man would lie to get out of paying his own faults (he only has liability)?  Even though I am young, I am not a bad driver. I have never gotten a speeding ticket nor have any bad records or encounters with police. They know I'm 19 and maybe they thought they could take advantage of a naive teen. They don't know yet about the witness and that my dad and I are willing to take them and their client to court. If you get hit by a USAA member, be careful because they will try their hardest not to pay even though it is crystal clear that the other party is to blame. Until then, USAA is a bogus company only concerned with their brand.",1210

But when it comes to insuring your home in Florida, USAA doesn't care if you're an active service member, veteran or retiree... they're going to jack up your rates to make you drop them as an insurance carrier. Apparently USAA doesn't want to underwrite policies in Florida anymore, so they're tripling or quadrupling their annual rates for coverage. My own policy that used to be $2,800 annually has gone up to $8,915 without warning. Competitive rates with other carriers are priced around $3,000 annually for the same coverage... that tells me that USAA is intent on driving their members away from them for home coverage. Talking to friends is what prompted me to check my current policy.

At that time, they offered me a rent a car for up to $900. I told them that I had another vehicle that I could use for the time being, but may need one down the road. But I got a different story after dealing with the very unfriendly woman who was handling my settlement. She made me an offer to settle the loss and I did not agree with the price she offered. So since it was apparently going to take awhile to settle, I asked for a rent a car as allowed in my policy. She told me she could only give me a week, not a month, since she had already made me an offer. I asked her to show me where in my policy it stated that, but she was unable to find it and she still refused to offer me what my policy allowed. That was the first issue.  The second issue is that I did not agree with the offer because it seemed lower than I expected it should be. So I did some research and found that they were almost $2,000 below the local market value for my vehicle. I was an independent auto appraiser for ten years and have valued thousands of vehicles for insurance companies. Therefore, I know how to come up with a market value. I spoke to her about the soft offer and after correcting a small error for an option she left out, she stated that is all she could offer and I would have to send in my own information that showed that my vehicle was worth what I claimed. I did just that. I sent in the only comparable vehicles in my market area and still, she would not adjust her offer. I even went back and complained to my original useless adjuster they assigned me in the beginning and one or two of their supervisors. I was finally able to get on a three-way call with them and the outsource company they use back east that supplies them with the vehicle values.  This company basically took every vehicle of my model sold within a two hundred mile radius of my home and added and deducted for equipment and mileage and averaged them out. That is how they came up with their artificial value. This is not a market value. I discussed it with them and they could not convince me that what they came up with was correct. They do not even consider any other source for vehicle values i.e., blue book, NADA book or dealer quotes. They only use their own concocted values. Also, USAA stated that the department of insurance allowed them to use car sales within a couple hundred miles of my market to get a value for my vehicle. However, the DOI told me otherwise and suggested that I file a complaint.  I have been in the insurance industry for almost 30 years and I have never dealt with such an impersonal arrogant company as this. Their salespeople are so nice and suck you in, but once you're in, you're treated like dirt. This is my second bad experience with them and soon to be my last. They know that I will eventually take their offer since I must now spend my money to hire an outside appraiser to help convince them to make a better offer. This is how they settle their claims for less than what they owe you. They make you spend money to fight them, knowing that nine out of ten, you won't, so they win.

I called in the next day to make sure someone comes in and assesses the vehicle and they okayed it, saying after the weekend someone will come in. After the weekend I called the shop to see whether someone came in or not—nobody. So I called USAA and they tell me I need to ""release the vehicle to them"" so they can tow it from Queens to somewhere in LI.  I told the woman that I didn't want to do that because as a commuting college student that is very time consuming and that I just want the car to stay and get fixed at that shop since it’s already there. She said that if I don't release the car to them it will be a ""total loss"" because of storage fees. So I called the shop and asked them about the storage fees and they said there are none because the car is repairable. I called back USAA and told them this and this woman was persistent that if I don't release the vehicle, then it’s a total loss. After a few minutes arguing I finally drove out to the shop to check out what exactly was going on. The shop got USAA on the line and once again the spokesperson was insisting I get the vehicle towed to their ""inspection station"" to avoid storage fees. The body shop owner was explaining that there are no fees since my car is in fact repairable.  So finally USAA gets all huffy and tells the shop they'll send someone in that day. Two weeks go by and still no one has bothered to go in to appraise the car. Finally, I get this guy by the name of Jay ** to look at the car and he deems it a total loss. At this point, I extended using the rental, which I got hit in my pockets, because someone incorrectly explained to Enterprise the way the rental car portion of insurance works. So Jay looks at my car and tells me it’s a total loss because there is ""too much damage"".  The company, even before going to look at the car, already insinuated my car is a total loss and the body shop owner was even appalled that the company was already totaling it out before even looking at it. Everybody at the shop said its fine, the car is drivable and there is no engine damage. The appraiser told me that the fans are pressed in and the radiator is up against the engine, but lo-and-behold I opened the hood and nothing is touching anything. The AC works fine, the car is not making any funny noises or overheating.  On top of that, he decided to take into account things that weren't even remotely related to the accident. I just installed TRD struts and spring and he told me I need a wheel alignment—which I do, but any knowledgeable mechanic would tell you after replacing the suspension is what needs to be done plus the little latch on the trunk of my TC.

I have turned in bank statements at least 4 times, in addition to replication of many other documents. My loan processor does not correspond with my realtor.

First, I had issues with the auto insurance when my car got broken into and I needed new windows - they said they couldn't provide a rental vehicle because the car was still drivable - there was broken glass everywhere and they were ready to send me on the highway with shattered windows. Just last month I switched to a new credit card and the automatic payments I had set up did not transfer over. I had no idea of this until I received a late fee. I reached out and they refunded the fee recognizing the automatic payment should have transferred with the new card. I set up the automatic payment and thought I was all set until I received an even larger charge and a lowered credit score this month.  Apparently the automatic payments do not go into effect until a whole billing cycle later. I reached out and there was absolutely nothing they could do. USAA used to be a company that advocated on their customers' behalf, doing everything they can to help them succeed. Not anymore. Their service has declined and they don't have their customers' backs. It's upsetting because they were a company I could count on.

Our car was at a full stop as was the other traffic in front of us when we were hit from behind by a USAA insured driver. She hit us so hard she moved our car at least 4 feet. Had my daughter who was driving not remained a couple of car lengths behind the car in front of her this would have been a multiple car accident. When we got hit everyone jerked forward. My daughter and granddaughters and I were all wearing our seatbelts. I hit my knee. Thank GOD that everyone else was OK. Screaming and crying, but OK. I finally looked back and the driver who hit us was just looking at us and then flew up her hands as if she were going to try and pull off and leave. I motioned NO WAY and for her to pull over. We both pulled over and I got out of our car while my daughter was trying to calm down her daughters - 2 years and 6 years. I met her at the back of our Volvo and showed her how she had shattered both rear taillights covers and one was cracked off on the side. She was frantic after she heard the children screaming, saying how sorry she was and if the children were alright and how it was her fault as if I didn't already know that after I assured her that the children and my daughter were shaken up but were ok and that I hit my knee, but the skin was not broken. She said that she was insured under her parents and I took a photo of her card and let her take a photo of ours. We did not call the police because we are on the interstate in the state of Georgia in 90 plus heat, our AC is not working, we are being honked at by cars during rush hour traffic and 2 children are screaming ""can we go now"". We just wanted to exchange information and go. The next day when I woke up my knee was twice the size as normal and throbbing. I don't have health insurance or money to go to the emergency room, so after taking ** and applying cold packs we file a claim with USAA. It seemed to go well at first. We gave them an account of what happened on 09/07/2016 and the representative of USAA spoke to their clients and they agreed with what we had told USAA - their daughter was at fault. USAA sent my daughter to get an estimate of the damages at their collision center, but said I would have to pay for my medical needs and then they would reimburse me. But I have no money so I ask him to refer me to whomever they use and I will go. He said they don't give referrals for medical evaluations, so I sought legal advice and that didn't go so well. They wanted me to lie about my grandchildren's condition and I would not do it, but they did refer me to a clinic where I didn't have to pay upfront and the Dr. said my knee was sprang and gave me medicine and set me up for a MRI and a follow up. But since I am no longer being represented by the lawyer I am going to be billed for that Dr. visit another expense that I can't afford. Now a claim that I thought would be handled smoothly is turning into a Nightmare! I still have swelling to my knee that just will not go away. It is very painful. I'm taking more pain medication and sleep aids than I've ever taken in my life. This has turned my life upside down. I just don't know who to call or what to do to resolve my situation. All of this caused by a USAA insured driver who ADMITTED FAULT! I'm not looking for millions of dollars, just FAIR COMPENSATION for our property damages and my personal injury to my knee, pain and suffering! My life was fine before this happened and now this has affected my quality of life with my loved ones! We are trying to talk to someone at USAA to see what is going on but are only getting the runaround! AT this point I'm not sure what to expect from USAA!",1238

I had only seen her once before and never since. Yet my insurance company (USAA ) continues to treat me evasively and like I had something to do with this. The insurance company decided to declare it total loss because it had been vandalized and the engine ruined.  I agreed to do an interview with the Investigator assigned by USAA and he made me feel extremely uncomftorable by repeatedly asking me the same questions over and over again even though I had already answered them to the best of my knowledge. The investigator, N. Thau, then asked me for my cell phone records along with service records and the extra key for the car. I called Mr. Thau a few days later and left him a message that the records along with the key were available for pickup at my office at any time. I did not want to send this additional key in the mail because I was afraid it would be lost and I felt that it was a key piece of evidence to let them know that I did not leave the keys in the car. I never received a call back from him nor did he pick any of the requested items up. A month later I received a letter with the title additional information needed. I called the adjuster (N. Guiterez) to ask her what the info was and let her know that the other items had not been picked up and she assured me that nothing else was needed.

I managed to get to the shoulder of the road at which time this whack job woman begins ranting and screaming that she was calling the police. I thought, ""Good, save my cell minutes."" The police arrived, took the report and issued her a citation. I called USAA to report the accident and discussed with my daughter how she felt and we felt we did not need medical attention immediately and would take the ""wait-and-see"" approach, neither one of us to make mountains of mole hills. I advised my daughter not to take any analgesics which might mask any symptoms and despite my recent surgery, I followed the advice I gave my daughter. We both felt sore, but thought that there was nothing seriously wrong. About two days after the rear end I began to experience increasing pain in my lumbar area where I had just had back surgery. My shoulders were on fire and headaches began to plague me. My daughter had some numbness in her arm from the seat belt, minor headaches and shoulder pain. We both went to the doctor as soon as possible. We began PT together and I awaited results of new MRIs which now included my cervical area as the neck pain on my left side was becoming excruciating. I was informed that in addition to destroying the progress I had made from my back surgery I now had two (+) bulging/herniated discs in my neck which created migraines, severe shoulder pain, guarding and eventually resulted in permanent nerve damage in my lumbar area extending out to my entire right leg. USAA was to cover up to $50K in medical expenses, which was an enormous battle in and of itself, but after obtaining numerous opinions from brain and spine surgeons across CT, I was told the damage was permanent and I have been reduced to pain management for the remainder of my life. Aside from dealing with daily physical pain, adjusting to a limited lifestyle and coping with the pain using every conceivable treatment I could find, from acupuncture, to inversion tables, to portable tens units, to yoga, and numerous surgical procedures, I was battling USAA at every turn. Unbeknownst to me at the time, USAA was submitting denial letters for my procedures under my daughter’s name to my estranged husband. They were sending them to an auto repair shop in New York despite the fact they had my name, current address and contact information on every document submitted to them, including multiple attached documents indicating me, my address and phone numbers in Connecticut . This included, but was not limited to spinal nerve block, spinal steroid injections, prescriptions and the like from doctors my daughter was never a patient of and for medications and procedures she never had. Upon my discovery of this, I called USAA and ended up forcing my way through to upper management and the legal division after repeated denials of their wrongdoings. I cited specific billing numbers and the management finally had no choice but to admit that they did in fact made errors and sent my estranged husband confidential medical information during which time I was embroiled in a bitter and brutal divorce. It was a blatant violation of my privacy and HIPPA. It took months before I was finally provided with all the documentation I now have to sort through to establish what and when my private, confidential medical information was divulged to a third party without my knowledge or consent. Moral of the story is to request any and all medical information related to your case. You may not know it, but they could be submitting your info to anyone. I, thankfully, have their repeated denials and subsequent admission of wrongdoing, along with a lame ""apology"" on tape. If they chose to ""delete"" theirs, I have mine. I record every conversation of significance so I can keep an accurate record of what happened and when for my own peace of mind. They know not who they are dealing with. This will come down like a sledge hammer when all the docs are in order. An apology simply will not do. Aside from the accident lawsuit, which has now taken more than 4 years, I continue to pay out of pocket for all my medical expenses and will for the remainder of my life. This just adds insult to injury, literally. This happened when I was only 41. I have a lot of life to live and it has been forever altered. I will never recover, I will never get ""better"" and if anything, I get progressively worse as each day goes by.",1264

I did, however, photograph everything while the driver's car was still in my creek clearly showing all damage. I then emailed the estimates to the adjuster and to USAA insurance. The total estimate is $2,640.00 for both landscape and pavement repair. Two weeks go by, and still no reply/response from USAA insurance. I then contact them via telephone, and get a song and dance as to how they haven't heard back from the adjuster. I then call back five days later only to have the rep on the phone contact the adjuster and have him call me. He then told me that although my estimates were received, he was prepared to write me a check totaling $768.00 for everything. I actually laughed at him, told him and USAA that they had two business days to contact me with a legitimate offer, or the next contact will be from my lawyer. I have yet to hear back from them. I contacted my lawyer who is perfectly willing to take the case; however, he feels that small claims court would be better suited for this situation. I now am going to miss my third day of work for this ordeal to file small claims case in my town, and have every intention of taking this to the full extent of the law including payment for my loss of time from work and all other fees I can.

USAA failed in over thirty day's to settle claim and has tried to place 20% responsibility on the driver of the stopped car. They also would not provide a replacement rental car.  After maybe 10 phone calls to inquire about status of claim we were told that they would only speak to us through emails. Every phone call had a different story. The 20% responsibility was that the driver that caused the crash said we did not have brake lights which a police officer cited the driver for. After the rear end collision that totaled the car. How a police officer can cite someone when he did not see the car before a rear end collision is beyond me. But three major insurance companies advised that brake lights are irrelevant in this situation and many cars sit at red lights without depressing the brake pedal. USAA is a lying and cheating company. I don't see how military organizations can support this lowlife company. The real killer is the car was only worth maybe $5,000.00.

My wife and I have been with USAA for many years with their banking products and loved them, so when we bought our house we naturally chose them as our insurance company. Needless to say, that seems to have been a mistake. Our roof was damaged over the winter due the massive wind storms we had, so we got ahold of a contractor who told us our whole roof should be replaced. The bulk of the damage was in one area, but there was minor damage across the whole roof that could lead to bigger problems later.  We filed our claim over two months ago and are still waiting. During this time we've had several more heavy wind/rain storms. USAA sent an adjuster from North Carolina (we live in Ohio), who not only told us to get ten more years out of our roof (we literally have shingles that are warping and barely still attached and our gutters are so full of shingle grit that they are pulling away from the house), but also told our contractors they should do something that's illegal under our state's building codes. I fully understand that a contractor will usually push for what will get them the most money, but after seeing the pictures of our roof, we were inclined to agree with their decision.  I am incredibly disappointed with a company I used to be proud to be a customer of. We'd already had to raise our deductible because they jacked up the rates in our area and now we just seem to be getting the runaround on our claim. These guys were awesome when they only had deposit accounts, but I would steer clear of their insurance. Multiple other customers of our contractor have already gotten their roofs fully replaced while we're forced to sit and watch as our roof gets worse then fret about having to repair those parts individually as they deteriorate (which will cost a ton). This is our first and only claim and most likely our last year with USAA insurance.",1295

We went and got two estimates and called them back with the amounts. They said because of the dollar amount, that they will now turn it over to their insurance. They turned it over and then the hell began. They sent out someone to estimate the damage made to my car and first off, they were supposed to let either me or my husband be present; which they did not do. Then, they later come back and said it was just a scratch and the damage was an insulting $34. The actual damage was at least $400 (the lowest of the two estimates we got).  We went back and forth with USAA over sending out somebody who could accurately estimate the damage and every time, they failed to return our calls or set up a time to do so. Fed up, we filed a small claim against the people who hit my car thinking that it would be faster to get the money from them since A) they left a note admitting fault B) they indicated working with us with regards to the damage by both talking to us and by two voicemails they left on our machine C) she knows what she did and from speaking to her, she wants this whole thing resolved too. After all, if the damage was only $34, why did she leave a note with her phone number saying let's work on this?  But currently, they haven't even picked up the note left on their door by the post office to receive the small claim that we filed. Now, I'm worried that their insurance told them to not pick up any mail that looks suspicious (ie: certified mail) so they could prolong paying us. And just to locate them has been a pain, and we may need to send out a sherriff or 3rd party in order to get this claim to them. The whole thing has been a fight with USAA.

About 3-4 years ago it started going downhill on the insurance side (be aware, banking wise I love it/checkings/savings). My vehicle insurance spiked, so I went to state farm this year and received immediate savings vs. usaa of over 300-400 bucks...for the identical coverage. I signed up for homeowners insurance when I bought my house last year at $1050.00 that was built into the mortgage payment. Suddenly, about 4 months ago it spiked. I was now paying a $100-$150 more per month because of the added insurance costs. That is unacceptable.

I have had 3 phone calls with support that were over 1 hour, and 2 other phone calls that were over 30 minutes. I am STILL trying to sort out my account hold.

The loan offer would most probably expire prior to completion of process and the loan closing documents that I executed have nothing to do with closing a loan. In sum, the loan process does not appear to result in loan closure even with loan document execution and confirmation of loan completion. Bottom line is, they wasted hours of my time with an unsolicited low rate loan offer that apparently can never really be closed or funded. It's an interesting business model. Totally aggravate your customers (member since 1999) with fictitious loan offers.

In fact when I called Farmers Insurance for a quote and then told them how much I was currently paying through for full coverage ($600/year) they were amazed and wanted to know who I was going through!!! They'd never heard of coverage so cheap. As an added bonus I received a fund sharing check at the end of every year for $100 to $300 - USAA distributes extra money made through insurance to its members. Despite getting my insurance through USAA, I did not sign up for a bank account (to this day I'm not sure why I didn't). Over the next 13 years I hopped from bank to bank thoroughly disgusted by fees, extra costs, and poor customer service. In 2006 I started banking with BECU (Boeing credit union) when I was doing a contract at Boeing. BECU was an excellent credit union - almost no fees (unless you took money out of a non-credit union ATM) and customer service was excellent. Then in 2008 I discovered USAA. Not only did USAA not charge any ATM fees at all credit union ATMs, but USAA ""reimburses"" you up to $15/month for fees you are charged by using non-credit union ATM's. This means that I don't have to wander around looking for a specific ATM and can withdraw money anywhere. To add to that, USAA has incredibly awesome rates on any type of insurance. I now also have my renters insurance through them and it's half the price that I could find through other companies. USAA is excellent when it comes to fraud - not only do they add what you mention to the fraud report, but they go back through your account to find other questionable fees and add them to the fraud report for you. AND they credit your account with the full amount of the fraud charges even before things are completely figured out. This way if you've had $1000 stolen out of your account you at least don't have to worry about being short on money to pay your bills while they're researching the report! When it comes to customer service I've never once been disappointed. Not only do they answer the questions I have, but they are 100% willing to look up other issues that come up. I was especially impressed when I took an extra 10 minutes to do a review to figure out how much I should be saving for retirement. Given that I plan to move into a tiny home and have no rent or mortgage, even the USAA customer service rep was amazed when it turned out that I only needed $700/month to live on for my retirement. The 'only' issue we've ever had with USAA was when my daughter attempted to cash out a CD she had and it turned out the proper paperwork at USAA's end wasn't done by the customer service member. Ergo, the CD was never switched out. But given that that is the ONLY issue we've had in the past 8 years of banking, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Oh, the other wonderful thing is that USAA makes it super easy to set up accounts for your teenagers! I started one for my daughter when she was 15 and deposited her allowance into it. Now that she's almost 21 she has excellent money skills thanks to all the practice and wonderful documentation that USAA has sent. And I still have 100% view/access into her accounts. :-) Also, since my entire family belongs to USAA we can easily pass money from one account to another if we ever need to borrow from a family member. It makes things much more simple. I just wish USAA had a service similar to Paypal since my recent experience when my Paypal account was hacked (and I lost $150) was absolutely horrendous. Paypal's customer service leaves A LOT to be desired. In fact I think I might call USAA tomorrow to see if I can't add that transaction to my list of fraudulent transactions. Anyhow, I HIGHLY recommend USAA. They are extremely understanding to everyone even if you only make minimum wage and don't have a lot of money. :-)",1331

I asked how/why they would have this idea since, I have never been diagnosed with any health problem or even seen by a doctor for anything related to the condition! The underwriter said that it was because of multiple orthopedic surgeries. I explained that I was a former athlete and yes, had some surgeries after injuries and 3 botched knee surgeries. I asked her where she got her medical degree and when she was able to examine me? She became belligerent and called me a liar. I contacted my doctor's office and they said that they had released records to USAA but, there was nothing in my medical records to indicate that I have RA!

In 2008, I attempted to get an insurance quote from USAA and was denied. When I asked the reason, I was told that there was a fraudulent claim made by my ex-husband which ended up going to underwriting.  Because I was married to him at the time the claim was placed, I will never be eligible for USAA services. I was never given the opportunity to prove that I had nothing to do with the fraudulent claim, nor was I ever contacted stating the status of my eligibility. I was also told by a USAA underwriter that my current spouse (22yrs retired military) cannot utilize USAA because he's married to me. He would have to divorce me in order to become a member.  What makes this case so interesting is that one of our adult children was able to open a bank account with USAA based on his father military service (my current spouse) and because he is joining the USAF. I cannot believe that a corporation who claims to support military veterans does not have a forgiveness or amnesty policy, or probationary membership set in place for circumstances such as this. Why should I be eternally punished, or even my current spouse be banished from USAA simply because of who you're married to? I thought it was based on honorable, military service?  I had no knowledge that my ex-husband made a fraudulent claim, and USAA did not allow me due process to prove my case and persecuted me like I was the offender. USAA stated that they cannot or will not tell me what happened because it happened so long ago.

I think USAA needs to revisit their membership guidelines/policies to include forgiveness clauses. Bankruptcy only stays on your credit report for 10 years, even forgiveness and second chances are granted to prisoners. If God can forgive people for their transgressions, what makes USAA think they're above the forgiveness of God?  My spouse is excluded from potential savings on insurance and banking privileges because he married me. What kind of message is USAA sending? Divorce your spouse and gain our membership benefits?

This isn't the first time this has happened. Last time, I ended up on the phone with an incompetent CSA for roughly 47 minutes, explaining my problem, and was told that there was nothing she could do; she didn't know why my payment wasn't accepted, and didn't actively pursue any methods for fixing my problem. I was simply told to call later, and the next representative I spoke with didn't have a clue, either.  Last time, I ended up waiting a full month to use my credit card, as the payment due date was the only thing left to do. Now, I've once again paid my card off early and beyond fully, and I am still declined. I'm bitterly disappointed, as this is my most reliable payment method on a daily basis, and loose cash is asking for trouble.

We had to hire a lawyer for our claim. My husband was permanently disabled. Their driver turned left directly in front of us. Went to arbitration. The amount the arbitration offered we felt was low. My husband had been a nurse making 38 dollars an hour. He was 57. He had at least 10 more years he wanted to work. He was a nurse. It was more than a job to him. It was how he defined himself he was the best. The lawyer had noticed my husband had not worked in a year before the accident and alluded to him looking for a patsy to support him. But my husband had lost his Dad his Mom And his Sister in less than 3 years. He had an inheritance that he used to try to live off of for a year. He needed to settle estates and quite frankly it's a lot of loss and he may of been depressed. He WAS NOT looking to screw anyone over.  The lawyer also brought up an accident by the year before that he stated my husband was in, it wasn't him though it was our daughter. He didn't even have his facts correct. After the arbitration they came back with a pretty low offer and they refused to budge. In today's economy they felt they would win the case. We were big city coming to a rural area looking for what they termed a big payday. We took their final low counter offer. They said they'd pretty much make him look bad. By the way his Dad had been insured by usaa for years and we had been considering changing to them though not anymore.  And my husband was an army trained Nurse and served for 13 years. So much for being for the servicemen and families. Every time I see their commercials I think hypocrites. So all I can say about this company is they don't pay crap to a vet that their driver disabled. And get this he turned directly in front of us and changed our lives forever over a roadside stand and a piece of homemade pie his driver was hungry for. This situation makes me cry daily.

I moved about 3 months ago. Changed my address online in my profile/account. They still have not figured a way to update their credit card to reflect that. I get declined for my online purchases and have to go back and re-enter my old address which I am no longer living at as the billing address. I don't feel comfortable putting my billing address as I don't live there anymore but that's the only way to get purchases to go through. Did some research and it seems to be an ongoing problem with this company.  Also, if I shop at more than 3 stores the same day, they will auto-block my card. I get that this is a safety precaution but it is embarrassing to get my card declined when I have done nothing wrong but just use it. I have to either wait for them to call me to verify my purchases or go online and verify. Then it takes a while for them to fix it and I can't use it anymore. Not very useful as I use it at trade shows where the purpose is for me to buy through several vendors within the short amount of time they are open.  The card is great for one time purchases and my credit limit is a nice high amount which I like. But since I'm so scared to use it on a ""shopping day"" it defeats the whole purpose. And I can't online shop because I have to ""bill"" an address I don't even live at!

So cleaning consisted of smearing soot into my wooden furniture, floors and sheet rock. The front and back porch were covered in soot which they neglected to clean so as all these different subcontractors continued to track and grind soot into porous surfaces in my home. I have an unusual form of COPD a disease that causes the hardening of the lower lungs which traps co2 in my lungs which further progresses the disease. In my case my oxygen levels stay in the 98% to 94% range when I am up and moving around however, at night when I am sleeping my oxygen level will drop into the low 80's and upper 70's which is considered heart attack and stroke levels. This has been the case since I was diagnosed and hospitalized for a very severe case of pneumonia. This requires that I use oxygen at night so that I am protected from these possibilities however it is a fatal disease.  Life expectancy is reduced when one does not follow these precautions. After the initial cleaning was declared completed, my porches were still covered in soot and no rugs or upholstered furniture had been clean at all. I went immediately back to my oxygen machine to find it covered in soot on the outside and when I took out the filter and ran water through it, the water turns a grayish black.

I left a voice message for Mr. ** on 12/13. However, I was never contacted by Mr. **. It wasn't until December 27th that USAA towed my car away. This was arranged by a Field Adjuster of USAA named Tyler **. I informed Mr. ** that my check engine light was on ever since my car was involved in a collision on 12/13/16. Mr. ** then had my vehicle towed away because he felt that my engine could be in jeopardy because my car was hit in the rear bumper and the exhaust pipe was damaged.  Mr ** stated that my car would be diagnosed to determine the reason why the check engine light was on. Waymon ** of Auto Nation in Lithia Springs, GA was informed about the potential engine issues on December 27th.

Over $7k in damages to my car that I had for less than a year. I had to take an ambulance to the ER due to neck pain. There was over 2 months missed work as I couldn't work on pain killers, physical therapy needed, etc. She borrowed her boyfriend's truck, apparently USAA was the insurer for their truck and my car. My adjuster was fast to put her at 100% at fault. However they would not give me a rental until another USAA adjuster put the other driver at fault. My adjuster did have my car towed the following morning when I advised her it would run but appeared to be highly unsafe to do so on a public road. They took over 3 weeks to offer a rental and by that time my car was repaired; 3 weeks to fix. They offered to pay for the rental after I got my car back. That was not nice, especially on a clear cut case when I was low on money. After 2 days of arguing for a rental, after the wreck, I had enough and lawyered up as I had a bad feeling about USAA not playing nice. That was a great call. The ER was wrong in their diagnosis and the spinal surgeon saw me twitching and knew what do. We spent about 1 year negotiating after I was at 100%. That was about 1 year recovery. In the end we had to file suit against everyone involved. 2 months before the first court date my attorney was in mediation USAA for another case. Apparently he had 3 cases with USAA. The issue got settled in mediation as USAA wanted to knock it out quick.. If you want anything actually done with USAA auto insurance claims be ready for a lawsuit and lawyer up early. USAA is cheaper than most other insurers. They are very nice and try to help, but..... when it comes to something major expect a fight. I don't trust them that much. I would point out I had a totally different experience when helping an old neighbor with a USAA renter's insurance claim. A car drove into the complex and my elderly neighbor didn't have anywhere to go. The city deemed his apt unsafe. He was rather stubborn to say the least, retired colonel. I spoke to a very nice renter's insurance adjuster. Told them what happened, and linked them to the news article. It was on 5 news stations. It was a weekend but they understood an emergency situation. They saw the city notice on his door from the news video.

I contacted USAA each time this occurred because of ongoing water from rain running in the walls of my living room. The result has been ongoing without any recompensation for the damages.

"1440",40555.18,"PETE","Stella","NC",NA,"auto",34.756033,-77.15405,"On Jan. 20, 2009, a man with a USAA insurance crashed into our building after passing 3 cars on snow and ice. His lack of common sense is a whole different story. He was running at about 60 mph on 1 inch-thick ice covered with 3 inches of snow on a curve which posted a speed limit of 45 mph (a double yellow line was covered by the ice and snow). So he went about 150 feet off the road through a fence and a drain ditch and came to rest about 5 feet into the 1822 Motorcycle Company`s Showroom. He wrecked 5 bikes and destroyed the showroom.  The result of this ** action were damage to the roof, which is now leaking; 26 feet of wall was hit so hard that the bottom plate cracked into 3 pieces; top plate busted in two and the roof truss cracked. The remaining wall and fence of about 60 feet were damaged as well as the parking lot from all the tow trucks and firetrucks and EMT's that showed up. So they sent a ** out to estimate the damage and he bids the job with an 8 ft ceiling when in fact my ceiling is 10ft. So right off the bat there is a 20% difference in bids before we even talked about the stuff they forgot to put in the bid like taking care of the parking lot, inspections, dump fees, engineers stamp on repair of truss and bottom and top plates.  We have been going back and forth over this matter in the last 2 years. All they have to do is measure my ceiling again, admit they goofed and add 20% to the bid plus the other stuff they keep forgetting about (like the damage to the parking lot and the fees for permits to do job). In all my life I have never had to deal with a lower form of life than these at USAA. I mean really now, should I have to waste time in court over this? The fact remains that my ceiling is 10 feet, how ** can one be to bid it for only 8 feet? Blaise **, Jennifer ** and J Adam ** are the main ones in this nightmare. I ask out loud to anyone who can tell me how can they do things like this? Do they think that if they say 8, my place will just shrink in the middle of the night from 10 feet to 8 feet so they don`t have to confess that they made a mistake? And to make it simple for everyone, we posted pictures of everything at **. There they can see very clearly that our shop has a 10 foot ceiling. Avoid USAA like you would a 20 dollar **. Let's see how has this affected us? Well for 2 years now the building has leaked every time it rains, countless man hours have been spent mopping up the mess and detailing bikes. The place looks like a flop house all boarded up on damaged side, which is the front side, parking lot is a mud hole from wreck, tow truck, EMT and firetrucks are everywhere, no curb appeal. Also, due to leaks and drafts, nothing can be put on consignment for fear that it does not move and the next rain may just damage them.  So I have been denied the ability to grow and expand due to the condition of the building that they refuse to pay to have fixed. I can't really put a number on that nor all the stress I have had to deal with between keeping doors open in a place that looks like a crack shack because of what someone else did and now what someone else won't do. It's very frustrating when you think about it. All I have ever asked from day one was to put me back where I was 5 seconds before this happened and they just can't do that. I can't even get them to admit the building has a 10 foot ceiling and that is a cold hard fact!  Because there was no personal injury but only property damage, no one really cares because this is a matter of what is right and wrong and not about money. If you came into my shop for repairs and I say it will be 450 bucks to fix and you say I give you 375, guess who is pushing their bike down the road not fixed. Lic Builder said it would cost this much to go away, so make it go away. How much have we lost due to this? It is really hard to tell but I do know my life would be a lot better off if this did not happen. Besides that all I have ever asked is that they just give me what is needed to fix everything and fix it right. I can't give a firm number on all my losses due to this but I can put a number on the repairs to fix it all back to what it was before Jan. 20, 2009.",1440

She forwarded me a promotion that was being offered to people opening a direct deposit $400 credit to savings as she knows that I am shopping for a new bank. I went online and saw that my previous account information was missing or removed, for what reason I do not know as I never produced a single financial exchange with them. I was hesitant to try to open an main account with them for this reason, and for the $10 monthly checking process fee which is shown just before you sign the online electronic signature. I went into the USAA Bank to open an account and asked whether USAA would honor the promotion, and, how is it that they offer free checking but the online fine print says a $10 monthly for the checking plus fee. The lady inside says they no longer charge a $10 fee, and both the lady AND the man that I spoke with over skype said that they would honor the promotion.  Only until after the man processed my $1200 account transfer (which I only gave with my permission assuming that they would honor the promotion) from my Chase account did they send me over to someone else whom says they cannot honor what it is they said. I asked then to place a stop to my account as I no longer want to open an account with USAA. They then tell me that it's impossible and I would have to wait 5 days until after the transfer is processed and put in a new request. I had limited time to spend at that bank today and at this point am still wasting time that I am taking off from work to perform this interaction.

We were SO PLEASED with them, we have everything through them! Mortgage, multiple car loans over the years, insurance policies on cars boats house, we have 3 checking accounts and our kids have checking accounts, and an investment account, we have a credit card account that we recently upgraded in Nov 2007 to a platinum account . Like I said we have it ALL!!! They were a GREAT bank we trusted our lives with them! Their customer service was superb! UNTIL, we noticed problems when they started the whole automated phone CRAP...  Their customer service was not as great, I ENJOY talking to a live person! And I HATE going through 100 prompts to get to one... We have made mistakes in the past of overdrawing our account, we would call them when we found our error and they would give us a cash advance on good faith. We didn't make many errors, but it happens... If we needed to skip a payment due to a duty station change, it was never any problem... We showed a good payment history.  BUT, in Jan 2008. USAA caused us a HUGE mess... We had switched our USAA Visa card Nov 2007 (we had the card since 1996) to a USAA Platinum card, we had an increased limit to 16, 000.00 and moved over the balance of 10, 000.00 from the other USAA visa card. My husband switched duty stations, Jan 2008 he was paid part of the moving expenses from the Military about 6000.00 so we put it on the Platinum card, thus lowering our amount, and increasing our available amount. We did this because we have to show moving expense receipts, and what over we paid on the card would go towards the balance of the card to pay it down, and our checking accounts have bills that come out monthly it was less confusion for all the transactions to come out of one account.  Jan 2008 my husband in route from Ft. Campbell to Ft. Eustis, fills up with gas a few times, books a hotel with his USAA platinum card, when he goes to check out of the hotel 5 days later, the transaction was DECLINED. We had over 7, 000.00 available on the card, USAA pulled all of our available credit and decreased our limit to 10, 000.00 without notice! My husband in route and money was to be used for moving expenses were GONE... We got the BIGGEST run around from customer service rep to customer service rep. and NOTHING was resolved, we explained the situation, we had no problems with our payments... But USAA would do NOTHING to put back the money, to help in any way! This was a lesson learned! YOU cannot TRUST a financial institute. This is our fault in the end, for not being guarded!

Another vehicle pulled in to the adjacent space and clipped my car door. I reported the details to my insurer (USAA), then heard nothing. I called them about a month later to inquire about the case and was told that they had decided to pay the claim - a claim from the other driver's insurance that I was at fault. I went crazy and started yelling at the claims rep assigned to my case. She chastised me for not paying attention and opening my door into a lane of traffic. I reminded her that I was parked in a parking lot when the accident occurred, but she refused to listen. After this my claims rep would only call my home during the daytime (when I was at work) to report updates on the case. When I would try calling her back, she would never answer so I was forced to communicate via trading voicemail messages.  As my car was also damaged, I needed to get it repaired and USAA dragged their feet in this regard, requiring the repair to take much longer than it should have. Worst of all, when I finally went to retrieve my vehicle from the repair shop, I was told by the mechanic that I couldn't because ""USAA won't release funds, they claim they don't know how you spell your name."" Recently I was informed by a USAA rep (via voicemail left at my home during working hours) that the case went to arbitration and I lost, therefore I'm at fault. At no time did anyone at USAA alert me to this arbitration nor did any representative from USAA ever ask for additional information to try and bolster my case.  My fear is that they are still wrongly convinced that I opened my car door while I was driving on the street, not while parked. So I strongly, strongly suggest not using USAA for auto insurance. It's cheap, but as the saying goes - you get what you pay for. In fairness to USAA, I did encounter one, lone supervisor who was patient enough to listen to me when things were unraveling a few weeks after the accident. However, she faded away. The long and short of this is that I'm now in the process of removing all my funds from USAA accounts (savings, checking, investments) as well as canceling my auto insurance.

However, recent events have me questioning my loyalty to USAA and searching for a new banking institution. It is with great confusion and anger that I report the following issue. USAA canceled my credit cards while I was on a business trip in Las Vegas last week. I was told that ""the activity was not typical for your account"" by the many service representatives that I spoke with over the course of the week. My first concern is the typical statement in that the representatives who determine activity level never followed through on looking at the facts before deciding what was typical for me. Had they followed through they would have seen the following in my history: 1) It is common and typical for me to travel to some other US city for a meeting during one week during June or July EVERY year; 2) Purchases were made during the months leading up to the trip that if they were looked at would indicate that I was traveling; 3) No one from the bank ever called me to see if I was indeed traveling. A simple phone call would have shown me that USAA cares. In fact about 5 years ago I did get a call from a representative about a large purchase that I was making. I was proud that my bank was taking care of me, but alas it seems that USAA doesn't care enough to call anymore. Of course we are told that this is USAA's protocol to protect us from fraud and I get that but my confidence that USAA can truly protect us when the facts are not pieced together makes me wonder how good you will be when real fraud happens. Look back at #2 in my list. So, no one thought to examine the account to see the pattern that would tell you I was traveling? That makes me scared. If they cannot see the simple pattern then what happens when a sophisticated breach occurs. Is the rubric for determining fraud so poorly constructed that it presents a false positive so easily? In my case again, it would seem that a simple phone call would have been warranted. We have been told that every time we travel within the US we need to alert you or the cards will be flagged and cancelled. That's inconsistent on USAA's part because in the past 10 years we have traveled to 4 or 5 cities PER YEAR in the US including Las Vegas (many times) and our cards were not flagged. Leaving me to again question the accuracy of the rubric. In both the issues from last year where our money was lost and this year our cards were cancelled while I was traveling and needed it, USAA has shown indifference to the humanity of its members. I ask myself now, is this where I want to do business? Are these the people I want to trust with my money? While it isn't much, we are just working class Americans, it is our money and I would expect that USAA would treat us more respectfully.

I have only had one claim during that tenure. In early August of '08, I was walking around in the back of my 1994 travel trailer, and my foot went through the floor near the outside wall. I brought the trailer to a local RV service center, and was told that there was some extensive water damage from a water leak, and I should probably contact my insurance company. I contacted USAA on 8/21/08 and explained to them my problem. On 8/22/08 an adjuster went and looked at the trailer.  After many calls and very unprofessional company representitives, 3 1/2 weeks later the adjuster has contacted USAA and told them that the water damage is wear and tear. USAA is telling me that there is nothing they can do for me, and I should have had the camper inspected 2 times a year for water leaks. I have owned this camper for 6+ years, and have faithfully paid USAA to insure it the entire time. If I had ever had any water enter the trailer, I would have done something about it imediately.  The RV center is telling me that it will cost thousands to repair the camper, as the 2 walls and the ceiling are severely water damaged and my insurance company tells me it's my problem. I asked them to show me in writing where it states that I needed to have my camper inspected 2 times per year, in order for my insurance to be honored, and they told me they couldn't, and that it was common maintainance on a camper.

Unfortunately, my years of experience with USAA has shown that USAA does not know what it means to serve their customers/members. When I challenged a representative in their insurance department that I had numerous experiences where their employees demonstrated that ""they do not know what it means to serve"" his priceless response was that he had served two tours of duty in the armed services and then hung up on me. Clearly, he was not familiar with USAAs commercial or their corporate slogan. I called the Office of the President to bring attention to the lack of common sense exhibited by their employee. They assured me that they would listen to the recorded call. While they agreed with my interpretation of their slogan's intended meaning that ""USAA knows what it means to serve their members"" and not only that ""USAA knows what it means to serve in the military"" they were unwilling to call out their employee for his rude and irrational limited misinterpretation of their slogan and his abrupt termination of my call.

To me it is more important to measure a company by how their respond to legitimate factual complaints about mistakes and errors in judgment of their employees and what they to mitigate or correct the error than that they made the mistake in the first place.

The first incident I walked out of a convenient store and my driver's door was crushed in and damaged. No witnesses provided any solid information other than white van. I was parked legally and did not see the incident. USAA treated me like a second rate citizen, but that's not the reason for the review. Fast forward four months. I was stationary in rush hour traffic. A pick-up truck side swiped me and kept going down the highway. The car behind me had a young boy inside traveling with his grandmother making a short video of the traffic to let his mother know he was going to be late. That video, caught the incident and got the license plate number of the pick-up. I gave that info to USAA and the police. Police report said, Not-at-fault Hit and Run. USAA again treated me like a criminal and failed to represent me throughout the process. A police report and the other's insurance company accepted fault, but USAA is only your best buddy if you never need them.  USAA left me stranded on the road and after four hours, I called a friend to come pick me up, lucky I know a guy that has a car hauler. My truck unsafe to drive was taken to the repair shop that fixed it four months prior. I am without vehicle, to no fault of my own, and USAA would not even help me with contact information for the other vehicle's insurance company to make arrangements. I paid my deductible, which is paid by the other vehicle when they are at fault, paid for my own rental car and my time. Yes, first you must understand the laws and industry standards. Law in my state says if you are a victim of a hit and run your insurance company cannot charge you a deductible or raise your rates. Well USAA did both for both incidents.  I bank with USAA, have my homeowner's insurance with USAA and my boat is insured by USAA. I am simply disappointed. All those years, they cashed my checks and smiled. I called GEICO to change over thinking it would cost more, and it is actually much less. I am paying for Auto Insurance and getting the house and boat for free.

On 11/29/14 USAA put our car into the repair shop and dictated to the repair shop Jordan Ford Collision, to only paint the bumper and to NOT do an inspection of anything else. An adjuster NEVER came out (we called daily to verify). We were never contacted with an estimate, we were never contacted regarding repairs, eventually they would tell us to call our attorney for information even though they never contacted him either. ON 12/04/14 Jordan Ford Collision called to say work was complete but when asked if there was any other damage, Nick ** seemed to be hiding something. We asked if they did an inspection of the vehicle and Nick ** stated ""no"" and that USAA dictated to only repair the bumper. DOT was contacted and both DOT & Ford did an inspection a few days later (after the ""repairs""). They found that my frame alignment was off and that my rear shocks were leaking. During this time USAA had us mail back the check from 11/28/14, and another adjuster in the office would call the car rental company to tell them the car was ready, when it wasn't, so my husband's bank account was charged the full amount of the rental that USAA initially stated they were paying for.

My husband delivers the check to pick up our unfixed Ford Flex SEL as we were told that USAA will not repair the collision damages that aren't aesthetic and if we keep the car there, Jordan Ford Collision will charge a daily storage rate - Essentially USAA is forcing close the property damage and leaving us to foot the bill for the damage caused by Pastor ** son (it will likely be several thousand dollars worth of repairs.) We have one car, and now that car is not safe to drive because his son ""Do you know who my father is??? I have an audition!!! My mom is coming to deal with you!!"" (My son was unconscious, and I was waiting for EMS to arrive. The teen's behavior towards myself and his friends swarming our car actually contributed to documented anxiety in my children. Thankfully we have insurance because USAA did not want to pay for the medical of my daughter's concussion, and my broken hand - they likely wouldn't pay for the therapy the kids need to deal with their anxiety. For children, being rear ended is scary, but to have a very aggressive angry teen come to your window immediately afterwards is overwhelmingly frightening.) I had always heard how wonderful USAA is, and even though my husband is a combat vet, they didn't even try to do what was right to repair our car for the damages from the collision. Their initial adjuster quit, so multiple adjusters who never communicated with each other were handling the account, and the only thing they agreed on was to not repair the collision damage. So thanks to USAA, our car is not repaired (but it looks pretty!), it's not safe to drive, and my husband's account is bounced because whichever adjuster called to Enterprise in the am on 12/18/14 told Enterprise to charge the FULL amount of the rental because USAA wasn't paying them. (The initial adjuster that quit had approved the rental.) With our injuries, USAA sent us to a Chiro. We ended up in an ER three times due to pain, and my daughter's seizures. USAA refused any other medical treatments, and we are being forced to use our insurance to cover the damages their driver caused both medically and with our property. (Our insurance kicked in on Dec 1st). I've been out of work since I was injured so it's going to be awhile before I can repair my car, if ever since the cost of repairs caused by USAA's client, is ridiculous.

I called them to attempt to get this corrected and their system verifies your phone number based upon the phone number stored in your profile and your four digit pin.

I waited three or four months until all charges were off the card from the old Master Charge card cleared. I called USAA to cancel the VISA card and they told me that it needed to be approved by a banking manager. After keeping me on hold for 10 minutes. The person came back on the line and said that a banking manager would call me on Monday. This did not happen and I never heard back from USAA. (3) Today, I called USAA banking to get rates on their CDs. This information is also available on-line, but I wanted to ask a person a few questions.

So we closed the USAA banking. In 2002. It is now 2016. We have multiple car loans, car/homeowners insurance, a credit card, and a personal loan.

I deposited money into the kids' accounts and noticed the amounts were never put into the accounts. After calling many times I find out they took 68.00 from a charge off from when we closed our account in 2002. WE HAD NO IDEA we even owed anything to them. All these years with everything we have with them not once was that mentioned or even sent us anything in the mail. So they took the money from my kids' accounts. Wow!! I was dumbstruck. I asked ""Why in the world with all the business we do with you did we not know about this?"" The man on the phone was kinda like wow also. He was very sorry and had no answers really. Told him it was not his fault. He probably was not working for USAA long. It's 68.00. Big whoop. Had we known we would have paid that no problem and I was not even told what those charges even are! We have no bank statements or account number to even check if that is accurate. The fact they did not even ask or call to say anything makes me upset so they just take it from children's accounts. We will be checking around to try and see about a better rate on our car, insurance/home and pay them off asap and be done. All of our credit cards give us the active duty rate. Nope not them.

We were both parked in front of our community mail boxes at the time, to be fair there is no dedicated parking in this area. The driver admitted that she did not look behind her before backing up. She was very apologetic over the incident and provided her USAA insurance information and immediately filed the claim via her phone application. She told me right at the time of filing that I would be contacted by Robert **. Who was the claims adjuster assigned the claim. I was not contacted until 3 days after the accident occurred. That was after I called, and spoke with one representative to make sure the claim had been filed, and called 2 other times and left voicemails with Robert.  Once he finally contacted me, as per normal procedure, he told me he needed a statement from me. I gave him my account as to what happened and he asked me a number of questions. That was fine, though it seemed to turn in to more of an interrogation rather than just getting a statement. Though the questions may have been customary, it was very frustrating to be asked over and over again for specifics such as how many feet was, I or the other vehicle, from this or that, and how many seconds until impact. When I responded a few seconds, it was a few meaning 1-2, 3-4, 5-6? I did not have a measuring tape or a stop watch at the time, and if those types of details were necessary, he should have contacted me when it was fresh in my mind, rather than 3 days later.  Before ending the 39 minute and 4 second conversation, he said that USAA was not admitting 100% responsibility at the time, even though their client HIT ME, as it was not that ""Cut and Dry"" of a case, but said he would set up a courtesy inspection for my vehicle as if it was a favor. The body shop contacted me right away to set it up an estimate for the next morning. After the inspection, I was asked if I wanted to schedule the repair. I replied that I hadn't heard back from the adjuster as to the determination of the claim, and asked if he could contact USAA first. He was able to reach another representative of USAA who told him USAA accepted 65% liability, but not an explanation as to why. I then called USAA at to inquire as to why they were only accepting 65% liability. I spoke to a representative, that said there was a Florida Statute noted as to why they considered me partially liable.  I left another voicemail for Robert and wondered if the determination had been made, why I hadn't been contacted immediately to explain the determination. He finally called back and said that the FL Statute noted, was due to the fact that I was parked at an angle and no part of my car should not have been more than 12 inches from the curb, therefore I was 35% liable, and said I could contact my insurance company, if I did not want to accept the determination. He did not offer to assist in scheduling a rental if I needed it, I had to ask, and confirm that it would also only be 65% covered. The whole experience was the worst I have ever had with an insurance company, my own, or other, and I felt that the claims adjuster had been very unprofessional from the start. I asked him how long he had been with the company, to which he replied ""that's irrelevant"".  I emailed USAA on 04/26/17 to file a complaint regarding the issue, to which I received an automated response saying that they received it and it would be reviewed as quickly as possible. It is now 05/03/2017, and I never received any reply at all from them. The details below are what I included in my complaint to them: 1) Their client admitted that she did not look behind her before starting motion in reverse. 2) My car was parked. The other passenger in my vehicle stepped out of the car to check the mail, saw her backing up and literally tried to stop her by yelling and trying to put his hands on her truck, and then jumped out of the way so he wouldn't be hit. 3) Their client still didn't look in her rear view mirror and admitted her radio was loud, which is why she didn't hear or see anything. 4) Their client was parked parallel to the set of mail boxes, located on the 2 lane road facing east. Once their client put her car in reverse and was in motion, she was literally driving in reverse on the left, therefore, the wrong side of the road prior to impact.  If all the factors above remained the same, it wouldn't have mattered if I was also parked parallel to the mail boxes, in other words not at an angle or incorrectly, their client would have still hit my car, it would have just been a different part of my car. It was not a large claim, less than $1000, therefore, I did not involve my insurance company, but given the facts, I feel as though USAA should have paid 100%, this is literally over just a few hundred dollars.

The car had damage to the front and back bumper but was still driveable. Later USAA called and said that the car was a total loss and that they needed to take possession of the car and title. They said they would give us $6100 (well below our car's blue book value). They also told us if we didn't accept the offer, our car would be listed as a salvage vehicle and lose its value. We agreed to let them take the car, expecting to have the check shortly after. We got a rental car from Enterprise while we waited for payment to buy another car. However, it took them almost two weeks to send us payment. When we went to return the car, Enterprise charged us $212 of unpaid rental car. We were told that USAA would only pay for 3 days of rental car. We also have not been reimbursed for medical expenses. We have made 12 phone calls to Ronica **, the insurance adjuster and she still has not returned a single phone call. Their (NON) customer service operators are no help as well.

I explained that the credit pull was not a current reflection of our credit because we had some disputes on our credit we had been fighting. They pretty much said 'oh well'. We pay our monthly payment on time every time, it just goes to show how little they actually care about their client-bank relationship.

After months of underwriter rejections and problem after painful problem and personal hours of negotiating and acting as my own representative with my current mortgage company on behalf of USAA (due to their inability to execute simple, everyday mortgage refinance requirements) I finally thought the end was in sight.  On Tuesday, 29 November I was notified by the mortgage processor from USAA that only two more things were required for the process to move on to the final step and then closing. First, there was a requirement to conduct a 3-way conference call (the 3rd such call requesting the exact same information) with a third party contractor with my current mortgage company, working on behalf of USAA to verify no late payments for the last 12 months. The call went without a hitch and the status of the account was verified with no missed or late payments for the last twelve months.  Second, was a payoff statement, the second one within the last two weeks. I personally called my current mortgage company and expedited the process and had the statement in my possession within 30 minutes. Even though USAA had verbal and written 3rd party authorization to this information, they could never obtain the payoff statement without my intervening. I spoke with my mortgage processor from USAA on Wednesday, 30th of November to verify all required actions and paperwork was in receipt. She assured me all was set and ready to go back over to the underwriters for final review. On Thursday morning, approximately 9:30 am, I received a phone call informing me that underwriting had rejected the loan because my wife was NOT on the title and that the entire process needed to start over. WHAT!?! I could NOT believe what I had just heard!  This process was now in the third month and just now someone notices that my wife in not on the title therefore making all the efforts and time spent worthless, null, and void. Probably the most frustrating aspect of the entire debacle is that my locked in interest rate from September of 2.875% no longer exists. I sent an interest lock extension request on Friday, 02 December in an effort to protect my rate as my current lock does not expire until the 12th of December. So far, I have received no response. USAA is a financial institution specifically designed to cater to and provide specialized and customized service to men and women in the military. After 21 years of faithful and dedicated service to my country, this is the treatment that I receive. I have never been so disappointed with ANY service received from a company in the course business negotiations in my 53 years of existence.",1512

USAA claims to be an organization that supports the troops and advertises in a way that makes servicemen and women believe that they are getting a great deal and that they will be taken care of. This is the biggest con-job I have ever witnessed. USAA is nothing more than another money hungry corporation that doesn't care about anything but sucking every last dollar they can from their members. I have been a customer for roughly 8 or 9 years through auto insurance and credit card. After several years of being fooled into thinking USAA had the best rates for service members, I discovered that they're auto insurance was more expensive than Geico, State Farm, Nationwide and Progressive. I ended up finding a local company that gives me the exact same coverage at a third of what I was wasting on USAA.  The worst experience with them has to be with the credit card service. They make the payments just high enough so that nearly all only goes towards interest. Like many servicemen and women with a family, times got a little tough with our finances so we turned to USAA in hopes they would be able to help as they advertise that they do for the troops. Money got tight and I needed to feed my family and provide clothes for my kids as they got bigger. I spoke with USAA over the phone in hopes that they would be able to work with me. They told me they could enroll me in a debt payment plan that would knock my payments down to half of what I was paying and that it would automatically debit my account on the 1st of the month.  Well a month went by and the new amount was automatically paid fine but as time went on I received a letter stating that I owed twice as much on top of what my new payment rate was. They informed me that it was a debt I owed before I started the new plan but the first time I spoke to them they informed me that I was up to date with my payments. When I asked one of their representatives why I was told I was up to date when I was still delinquent, she said ""because most people don't like to hear that they own money."" No kidding but you shouldn't lie to your customers and tell them they are up to date with their payments when they really owe more.  Now I'm on the verge of being reported to the credit bureau for owing money all because this person wanted to avoid telling me I owed more money than I was advised from the beginning. Many people have budgets and unfortunately have to live pay check to pay check and have to budget everything that comes in. It's hard to do that when people like USAA give faulty information all because people ""don't want to hear it."" I don't like hearing that I need new tires on my car but it's something I need to know so I don't end up with a blow out while I'm driving down the interstate. I would like to say this is the first time USAA has let me down but that would be a lie if I did. USAA advertises they are for the troops but prior to this incident, I have almost always been on time with my payments and each time I called in hopes they could help me by lowering my interest just a little bit, I always get rejected.  I used to be a loyal customer and wasn't late on payments. Tell me USAA, how exactly are you here to support the troops when all you have caused is heartache, stress and disappointment? When I spoke with the representative earlier today, I told her that I would no longer recommend USAA to anyone she stated ""that's too bad because you're going to be keeping people from the advantages USAA offers."" What advantages? The best experience I will have with USAA is the day everything is paid off and I never have to deal with them again. The only thing I ask is that USAA stops taking advantage of young service members that don't know much about how your services work. Please stop preying on the troops while advertising how much you care for them. Instead of being the solution, you are currently the biggest burden on my family.",1514

(The value of the dwelling in FL is about 2/3 that of the house in CT otherwise limits identical.) I obtained quotes from other carriers through local brokers with identical limits to the USAA quote at approximately 25% of the premium USAA quoted. USAA Underwriting could not give me a reason for the discrepancy in rates nor would they make any adjustment in their quote. As much as I like USAA I am not paying $7,000 more than I need to just to say I am insured by USAA. To add insult to injury, USAA has just informed me they will not be renewing my USAA umbrella liability policy due to my carrying my homeowners coverage through a non-USAA insurer. If I want to continue umbrella liability insurance through the USAA ""General Agency"" with a non-USAA carrier my premium would rise from its current $285/year to over $600/yr.

I own a vacant lot in my retirement account (IRA) and need a ""certificate of Insurance"" on that lot to prove liability coverage under my Homeowner's policy. This is usually an easy and mindless thing to do with any other company. It's a one page paper listing the policy number and the insured property description and the term of the policy. USAA sends me one with my policy renewal but they can't manage to put the address or legal description of the other property on it until after I spend hours on the phone with them, and this charade repeats annually. With USAA, you can never talk to the same person twice. All you get is a call center 800 number and you deal with whoever answers the phone. Each year for 5 years, I go through the same hassle of perhaps 5 different calls talking to different people, being put on hold for 15 to 30 minutes, being told they figured it out and then finding it didn't get done and starting over with a new person. I asked if the agent could just figure it out and phone me back. Their response was, no, because it is a call center and as soon as they hang up with me they would get another call! So I wait on hold for up to 30 minutes per call. I asked if they have a Consumer Support or Problem Resolution department, but was told no. I asked if I can speak to a supervisor or someone higher up since I go through the same 8 hour frustrating hassle each year and finally get what I need, and again am told no. The agent has said they enter the solution in my file to make it easier next time, but it never is any easier! I ask if I can email them what they sent me last year so they can see what I need, but NO, they cannot receive email. Nor can they send email. Instead, they post the new document on their online site which is a real hassle to log in to and finally find your message center. Then the document is never there so I start all over again with a new person. Finally I find a competent person who makes the correction with no problem. I even get their name and employee number, but that does me no good next year because you cannot ever get back to the same person. You have to go through 4 more incompetents to finally find one employee who knows what to do. What a useless and totally consumer unfriendly bureaucracy. USAA is as bad as the Federal Government.

USAA took over the claim even though it wasn't our fault and paid us for our car. They did not send anyone out to look at our car for value estimation--instead they use a third party company for calculating the cash value. This third party went on AutoTrader website and picked two vehicles that were way over mileage compared to our car and the very lowest price they could find. They ""adjusted"" for mileage but they massively underestimated as verified by my own research. This was how they determined the value of our car and what we would be paid!! Two comparisons they found on AutoTrader. I couldn't believe it. So they shorted us about $2500-$3000.  I repeatedly complained and asked for this to be handled by USAA manager but no one helped me. I did my own research and found more accurate car comparisons (on Autotrader and several other sites) and sent those to USAA but so far they are completely ignoring my request to review. They kept telling me they weren't paying replacement value which is not what I was asking for. Simply put if I was to have gone out and sold my car a day before wreck (the ""cash value"") I would have easily gotten $18,000. They only paid me around $15,000. So why does my own insurance (USAA) short me several thousand dollars when the accident wasn't even determined to be our fault in the first place? We may have gotten money a little quicker by USAA getting involved but they should have acted in our well-being and if we believed and had examples that our car estimate should have been higher--then they should have pressed the matter with the other insurance and not short-changed us $2500+ dollars. So buyer beware--I never missed a payment and had two home and two cars insured with USAA. It doesn't matter. Their process of cash evaluation of cars is not even handled by them so they do not care about loyal customers. I expected no special treatment just a fair estimate of car value. USAA process for valuing cars with this third party is appalling and quite simply a lazy way out.  I figured out I had paid roughly $30k+ in USAA premiums over the last 10 years and this was how we were treated in our time of need. They put this responsibility into some third party company who did the least amount of work possible to give them the lowest possible value on our car from their two vehicle Autotrader ""research"". I will be canceling all policies with USAA and buyer beware in your time of need I would not expect USAA to be there to help and ensure you are treated fairly because clearly in my case they were more interested in giving me the lowest possible value for my car/property and little care for me as a customer.

It is likely that and even higher percentage would not recommend them for insurance for a rental property. USAA does not cover small leaks lasting more than 14 days, whether you know about the leak or not, nor do they cover massive sudden leaks, at least not in my situation.  I own a rental property that apparently developed a small leak underneath the sink that caused some mold. I did not know about the problem because the renters did not tell me about it. What does USAA expect me to do to protect myself inspect all potential water leaking sites in the rental unit every 13 days? One of the reasons you get insurance for rental properties is to cover you for dumb things a renter might do. I suspect there previously had been a small leak somewhere in the sink area before as there was mold beneath the sink. But then the drain pipe beneath the sink became completely disconnected and caused flooding of my unit and the unit below. That is when I became aware of the problem and immediately contacted USAA. I assumed USAA would at least allow damages to my unit secondary to the huge acute leak that flooded the lower unit, but a month later they are still denying the claim because of the separate slow leak that caused mold.

First of all at the scene of the accident it took three phone calls, and five minutes on hold just to speak with somebody. When I realized there was an issue with my coverage upon contacting them about a previous conversation to fix the issue their response was, ""we have no recording of the conversation, and after speaking with the original representative no recollection of the conversation. After realizing there was an issue with my coverage in March of this year, they fixed the coverage on one vehicle, and not the other two. All three vehicles were asked to be changed. The response on one of the vehicle, ""sorry you're not covered"". I stated I know there is a problem with coverage. I had asked for it to be fixed. As you can see there is not much concern for helping, just an apology. Just read the other 916 reviews. I now have to pay for an accident myself, that I should have been covered for if someone had done their job. I will have no way to pay for the medical attention I need simply because USAA does not care. It is against their guidelines to help you out. I am in an industry that we have paid tens of thousands of dollars to fix a situation simply because we care about our clients and our company's good name. The company that is suppose to be there to protect the military has no interest in doing just that. Don't waste your money. There are many other insurance companies out there that will truly look out for your best interest, and would gladly have your hard earned dollars.",1536

I have been involved to 1 accident involving multiple cars and a few other claims more recently. I have paid my premiums in full and on time every year, yet because they had to shell out over $1500.00 within the past year (while I still pay them 75% of that in premiums) they have decided to drop me. USAA prides itself on servicing our veterans and active duty members to the highest standard, yet I was dropped for having one unfortunate year after 10 years of problem free driving.  I find this deplorable act to be incredible frustrating and dishonorable. I personally believe insurance to be a complete scam against the public the fact that one company will drop a loyal customer because said customer no longer is profitable is very disheartening. I have no intention of seeking a resolution with USAA and advise others to be careful driving because even the most careful of drivers cant plan for the unexpected, especially once you start needing insurance to help you out, because lord knows they wont.",1537

I knew they wouldn't even process the claim until I called them from all the complaints I've heard and read. I called them several times and had to push to get them to cooperate. It took them a week just to read the police report (which was sent a day after the accident), get a statement from the policy holder, and accept liability. Mind you, I had to call them almost every day for a week. They said that they would set me up with a rental and pay for it. They knew I was 19 years old.  I went to pick up my rental car today and found out that USAA is refusing to pay for the underage bracket fee, which I cannot afford ($22 per day). I was told by my adjuster that because I am under no fault, any cost that is a result of the accident would have to be covered by USAA, yet they refuse to pay for my rental car. I have no way to obtain transportation, and there is no possible way for me to use public transportation for my job. There is no way I could even use a taxi to get from house to house (I clean houses) let alone afford one. Chances are I am going to lose my job over this. I am afraid that I am going to have to take this to small claims court. It is hard to believe that USAA could be so ridiculously inconsiderate about these claims.  How they are even allowed to practice as a business is beyond me. Is USAA a federal business? That would explain it. Either way, judging by my situation and the other complaints on this site, it is safe to say that they are a bunch of crooks. I am not one to insult, but the problems that they are causing me are outrageous. This should be illegal. I have spent over $100 in just one week to have friends drive me everywhere I need to go. Furthermore, I can't afford this anymore, considering I only make $40-80 per week. I will most likely lose my position due to USAA's lack of cooperation.",1538

First, while there are no USAA branded ATMs in my area, literally any ATM is ""a USAA ATM"", which makes it so much easier for me to have access to my cash when I need it. Secondly, their mobile deposit service is excellent. Recently they upped my daily limit through mobile deposit to $100,000, although I don't think I will ever reach that limit. Third, and finally, their online website is fantastic. I have all my retirement, investment, credit cards, and loans connected, so that when I log into my USAA account, I can see my entire financial situation on my screen. I understand that there are others who are not experiencing the same high level of service from USAA that I am; and part of the reason I suspect is that USAA is very strict when it comes to financials and some individuals, who fall back on funds, experience difficulties with USAA. In my opinion, as long as you are financially responsible, prevent overdrafts, and keep your account secure, you'll experience the same high level of service I do. USAA is not for everyone; some individuals might be better off using another banking service that is not as strict but also charges additional fees to make up for the financial problems their clients experience.

On 6/26/11, I walked into my home to find that it had been burglarized. I had been in and out of town, and it is an unusual case, as the police think that someone had been living in my home. I have an insurance policy with USAA insurance. I have been through 4 or 5 adjusters. I have given way too much information about my life, and that of my February of 2008 to help care for my mother.  My mother passed away in July of 2008. My sister and I cared for my grandmother until my sister moved back to Michigan to work for the Department of Commerce in October 2009. I stayed in Missouri and worked for US Bank through Kelly. After my job ended, I traveled around. I helped my sister pack up her apartment in Michigan and move to Atlanta, GA in January 2011. I traveled back and forth between Michigan, Georgia, and Missouri. In February of this year, my step-grandmother, who had lived in my home after my mother's passing (she lived in my home until October 2009; at that point she moved to Beauvais nursing home, on Magnolia, in Saint Louis, MO) passed away in February.  On the same date of her funeral in March, my maiden aunt, Barbara **, left the hospital for the emergency room, where she was diagnosed with Uterine Cancer and subsequently had surgery. She has been going through chemotherapy and my sister and I have been up and down the highways taking care of her, as we both worked to rebuild our lives.  On June 26, 2011 I returned to my home to find that it had not only been burglarized, but it appeared to have been lived in. A realtor who was selling a home down the street had a sign in our yard, with a For Sale sign, with the arrow pointing to a home down the street (it gave the appearance that my home was for sale). At one point, I let the mail collect when I was caring for my aunt, and the post office put a vacant sign on the mail box. We think that this was when thieves moved in and burglarized and trashed the place.  I have neighbors who have witnessed strange people and reported this to the police on the day of the burglary and have called twice since to report people lurking about my home. My mother was an OCD neat freak and the house was so torn apart that it looks like an episode of Hoarders. I had many high-end handbags, as did my mother, lots of crystal, and Jewelry. I inherited a lot from my mother and grandmother. I have answered questions about my lifestyle, worked with USAA''s insurance investigator. I have receipts for over $14,000 of jewelry that I purchased when I worked on Wall Street.  I have bank statements of things that I owned, credit card statements of what my mother owned, and copies of credit cards that my grandmother had. I have provided pictures. My sister has answered questions (she had to establish that she had a home in Michigan), answer questions about what she received and why it looked like I had more (I did not, Holly''s things were not stolen, mine were). My mattresses have been slashed, the fridge broken, the oven broken, thousands of gnats in my home, as USAA asked me to keep the broken fridge, as I went through 5 claims people. I thought that I provided way too much information.  In some instances, I have the receipts for items, pictures, and have located them on the bank statements and have been asked to provide more documentation. I cannot comfortably stay in my home, and now my aunt, in addition to the chemotherapy that she is enduring, has diabetic issues, that may cause her to lose her legs. My sister and I are her only relatives. After the tornado here in Saint Louis, I looked at my policy and upgraded it. USAA sent a letter to homeowners advising that we do so. I think that between what I purchased, what my grandmother and my mother left me, I had $100,000 in jewelry. I may have had $10,000-$40,000 in jewelry coverage, over $20,0000 in silver was taken - I may have had $10,000 in coverage. I had a total of $299,000 of coverage for personal items and with damages, my claim may be between $270,000 - $280,000. The claims investigator is telling me everything is in the hands of the adjuster, just get in my receipts and pictures, and the adjuster is stating that he must turn everything over to the investigator first. I have spent time that should have been spent on family and getting my home and life back in order jumping through hoops. I would like to retain your services, as I have made a commitment to get everything to the claims investigator and the insurance company over the weekend. I do not want to do this all in vain. I feel like I have been violated twice. You have a good reputation and I would like to hire your firm to assist me in finishing this claim. The complaint is against USAA, 9800 Fredericksburg Road, San Antonio, TX 78288 for Claim problem, Claim delay, Premium problem, Policy problem. Details of complaint follows:  My original policy began with USAA in 2007. Since my emails to Mary **, those emails with all the policies have been purged. I purchased this home in 2005. At the time I lived in New York and had renter's insurance on my New York apartment. My mother lived in the house full time. I traveled with my job and I had a policy on the house. In October 2007, my mother was diagnosed with ALS, Lou Gerhigs. My sister lived in Michigan and had a ranch style condo covered through USAA. All USAA policies held by my sister, my mother, and myself, fell under my dad, Ronald **.  My sister walked away from her job to care for my mother. During that period the pipes burst. USAA paid her about $15,000 and then dropped her and her claim, stating that there was an invoice from the cleaners that had a weight on the unsavable clothing they returned to her. For that reason they dropped her claim, stating that she added an unsavable clothing box, even though USAA sent her the invoices. They closed her banking account, everything.  As my sister was the only one caring for my mother, she lost everything and had to declare chapter 7. My dad, a diehard ex-military man had USAA on his two homes and 5 or 6 cars. There was never a claim. On February 14, 2008, I walked away from my job in New York to help care for my mother. I notified USAA. In July 2008 my mother, a nurse, passed away. I notified USAA and continued to care for my grandmother in my home until October 2009. At that time, my sister got a job as the assistant manager for quality assurance in Dearborn, MI. She did not have much to move, as she lost everything to water and mold when the pipes in her home in Michigan broke in several locations.  She got a U-Haul and moved her things to Michigan. She has a lease, a business card, and paperwork, from December 2010 where the moving company picked up her furniture for storage, and then where to deliver it when she found a place in Georgia. My grandmother was 110. She loved Xmas. We left the Xmas tree and lights up from Xmas 2010 and had a special 2nd Xmas for her in February 2011. My sister and I actually missed the first Xmas in December. We were in Michigan packing her apartment.  Lena was staying in Beauvais Manor by that time, but she came home for the special Xmas. She is in the photo below along with how the house looked just months prior to the break in. There was a lot of sorrow. We lost my mother in July 2008, my sister's paternal grandmother (who always treated me as a grandmother) six weeks later. In October 2008, we lost her paternal Uncle. Then in July 2009, we lost her paternal, youngest aunt. It was just too much. My sister's job was over. I came to Michigan for a while in April. I had been working for US Bank in Saint Louis and was working through Kelly Services so I was in the home alone.  My sister decided to move to Atlanta. Her things were picked up by the movers and were to be placed in storage until she found a home in Atlanta. All this information was given to USAA. After the death of my grandmother, on the very same day as her funeral, my Aunt, Barbara **, was diagnosed with Uterine Cancer. Literally, we left the funeral for the emergency room. My aunt had surgery. After a recovery period, she was to start chemotherapy. I joined mysister who was living at an extended stay hotel to find a home. She decided to find something that my aunt could stay in. I went to Michigan with her, helped drive the car from Michigan to Atlanta, and we looked for a place for her to live.  After finding one, we returned to Saint Louis as my aunt was starting chemotherapy or had started and I was taking her to her chemo sessions. So I was back and forth out of town a few times. I do know that in April there was a major tornado that hit Saint Louis, Missouri and ripped the roof off the airport and left devastation following highway 270. I received a letter from USAA about the tornadoes and asking if I had enough coverage. I really took that to heart and I changed my policy. The primary changes were for the structure of the house, but I did add a jewelry rider. I inherited much from my maternal Grandmother, my maternal step-Grandmother (she was the one who passed in February 2011) and my mother, as well as my own things.  I received a call asking if I was going to cancel the other policies on the home and the renter's insurance. I let them know that had been cancelled long ago. The customer service person indicated it was not. USAA will not send a copy of this update. I did add $40-$45k in jewelry coverage and was still woefully under covered. I received a letter stating that due to my credit history, which took a traumatic hit during my mother's illness, the policy was changed. What I did not know was that I continued to pay for 3 policies after USAA was told time and time and time again.  After the report of the theft, I was under investigation for 6 months. I was never notified officially and I cooperated spending time that I was told that I would be reimbursed for, due to my cooperation. I was paying out of pocket for everything. I sought assistance and got a Public Adjuster, Inman and Associates, who have been a sad disappointment. It has been 18 months since my claim. Missouri law and my own policy have not been followed. Since USAA does not give money back, but gleefully took it and continues to take it, then I should have additional coverage.  As credit score cannot be utilized in Missouri, my jewelry rider should be acknowledged. USAA has had a spreadsheet of stolen items for 6 or 7 months. The public adjuster and Chris ** are still ambling around on the dwelling. This is my claim and I want to replace my stolen items. I would like my ALE that is due. This company has put such a financial strain on me that it has taken its toll on me, my sister, and my aunt, who passed away November 19. Additional family members, six of seven, have passed away during this time.  Our Aunt was our mother's older sister. I do not want to spend another Thanksgiving (which ended up being a trek to get my aunt's body). Medicare wanted to know after her amputation that she had a place to go (prior to all of this she lived on her home). Barbara had too many steps to return to my home and it has been 18 months and Josh ** is is charge of stolen items. It has been 18 months since they theft. The criminals were living in the home, they defecated, urinated, stole the motors or some workers from all 3 fridges in the home.  Since it took USAA 3 months to come to the house, it was filled, like a horror movie, with millions of gnats. Over 18 bug bombs were set off, there are gnat bodies and poison in everything. The police found tons of medicine boxes and pots with stuff stuck in them. I was told my home was possibly used for meth. ARRS, the restoration service, deemed almost everything as unusable. Now USAA is questioning ARRS and there has been no movement on the home. Furniture that was in the home was broken and almost all household items placed in the garage. The gnats are back.  If items were saveable, they are not now. All furniture in the home down to the dishes were purchased new when I bought the house for my mother. Her partner and fiance had died and this was a new beginning. The only things not new, were the dining room set, the master bedroom set and the 2nd bedroom set and one television in the basement. All other furniture were purchased in 2005 along with the carpet for the basement. Except for the china, all dishes, mixers, toaster, microwave, pots, pans dinette set, living room furniture, basement furniture and patio furniture were new as well as all decorations.  My grandfather fought in WWII, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. There were many heirlooms that he sent home. I had photos and I had to show what I inherited versus my sister. There was much silver, Waterford, and Japanese ivory and such. There are pictures of the items in the home, and I had to account why I had photographs of the items and the photographs were clearly years old. USAA has put me in a financial bind. I could lose this home. I want to know why we cannot work on replacement of theft which is what I asked for from day one. The house really needs to be gutted, disinfected and fixed.  I need to know how much I have in coverage since I was paying for 3 policies. I have read the policy and found all the breaches, not Inman and Associates, my public adjusters. They seem to be inept. I am begging for any assistance as rules in my policy have been ignored, Missouri law, and it is 18 months. This is crazy. I don't want to live in a hotel anymore. I want funds immediately for replacement of stolen items and a clear answer of how much coverage I have since I was paying for 3 policies up until 6 or 7 months ago. I will email all information instead of attaching it. USAA has been busy since I contacted you purging documents that have been on file since 2007. I believe Josh ** may have gotten rid of everything with his name on it.",1547

With USAA checking, 'NSF' is typically not created by 'insufficient funds' rather it's created when they place 'restrictions' and 'holds' on funds rather than pay the bill i.e. self-created $29.00 fees... The previous comments are accurate, so no need for me to repeat the same facts about USAA BUT the intentional creation of bounced checks by doing same-day draws is illegal. I've had check deposits on the first day come back 'NSF' because the funds were not in the account yet, this is generally caused when a 'refund' is processed and the funds do not appear for a day or two... What USAA claims is NSF is actually fraud because the 'agent' did not allow normal check processing and electronic processing of a day or two. For this 'agent' action, I'm actually planning to sue, because it was only done because I had an argument with the phone agent. But the real killer about USAA and the 'Military' is that millions of people do not realize that 'Active Duty' and 'Veteran' accounts are treated differently. 'Active Duty' accounts will almost never ever get a $29 NSF fee whereas 'Veteran' or 'Retired' accounts are fair game for $29 fees and holds... This will all in up big big news with USAA sooner or later when the first lawsuit hits USAA and its 'Active Duty' military scam...",1552

The driver of the other vehicle admitted responsibility and nobody has questioned that. It was a pretty hard hit with both the wife and I experiencing whiplashes to a different extent. We had decided to go home and recover but on the way home decided that symptoms of a injury problem warranted being checked out by the hospital. The emergency room physician acknowledged the presence of the injuries, but in agreement with my wife and I, decided that we would take a ""wait and see"" approach on the significance of the injury prior to running up medical bills by getting CT scans, etc., at the time. After a few days, I was feeling better about the healing process of my neck and decided to stop any medical claim beyond the initial emergency room visit. I wasn't trying to capitalize on a minor injury. I didn't want to be stressed out over this. I just wanted the accident behind me, which is both reasonable and honest. When the rep from USAA phoned me wanting to resolve the problem, I told them that all I wanted was for the initial emergency room visit to be paid for and that would satisfy my medical claim. The rep from USAA insisted on sending me $150 for pain and suffering, which I assumed to mean that something had to be paid to me for them to be off the hook by law. After consulting with my insurance company, they stated that they had no problem with that. So I cashed the check, and five months later, USAA has failed to be reimbursed for what they paid out. The balance of the hospital bill hasn't been paid and I am considered liable for the delinquent bill. As for damages to my car, rather than go out and seek multiple estimates for the damages to make sure that I was being dealt with fairly, I agreed to accept the estimate presented by their appraiser; and in exchange for quick payment, I agreed to let them off the hook on the rental car expenses. So they took care of this portion of the claim.  My wife, on the other hand, had some knots form on her upper spine and neck and this required some physical therapy. After a couple of months, she was released from therapy care and we took a trip to visit family. The ride resulted in the problem in her neck returning, requiring (I'm thinking) a couple more visits to the physical therapist. Whereas my wife has other medical problems, this injury just added to her previous limitations. For a while, I wouldn't even sleep in bed with her because I was afraid of accidentally rolling on her in my sleep and adding to the pain she was experiencing. And now, five months after the accident, and two months after USAA insurance had received the medical assessments and medical bill totals, the bills haven't been paid. They've made no effort to offer her anything for pain and suffering, future therapy for flare-ups of the accident related injury nor pain and suffering. We didn't hire a lawyer because just as we had showed good faith in the handling of my medical claim and damages for my car, we had hoped that USAA would appreciate this and would resolve the matter of which we twice already had worked with them.",1553

Consider the following: In 2013, we had wind damage to the houses in our neighborhood. This affected many roofs. Many homeowners insurers replaced their entire roof, including my neighbor's. I had a roof inspector inspect my roof and recommended a full roof replacement. USAA hired THEIR OWN INSPECTOR who concluded that only half of my roof was damaged and therefore, only half the roof would be paid for. After a $5k deductible, they offered me a check in the amount of $2k plus, which I refused. So, in spite of the fact that my direct neighbors had full roof replacement and my roofing inspector concluded same, they dug in their heels on their position. I refused their inadequate offer. Fast forward to 2015. Hail storm. This time my roof inspector and THEIR ROOF INSPECTOR recommended an entire roof replacement. So what do you think happened? USAA said that because we didn't act on the 2013 claim, the statute of limitations ran out and they were not responsible to fix that half of the roof!! So, although the entire roof is in need of replacement, they will only replace half the roof gain, but charge double the deductible ($5,000) because the incidents happened in 2 separate years! UGH.

His truck was willed to him by his grandfather who passed away three years ago. My son (stepson) got the truck in April, when he turned 16. By law, he cannot title a vehicle in his own name because he is a minor. By law, he cannot get insurance in his own name and this is USAA's policy also (at the time we had USAA and still do).  We could not find any insurance company that would give him insurance without an adult, being a legal guardian or parent. His biological father would not put his name on our son's title or insurance (I'm married to his mother). So for our son to drive his truck, she had to be on the title and insurance. We have three vehicles and our house thru USAA. Each vehicle has a policy and they are in my name because I am retired military. His truck only has liability and comprehension. USAA has a one-line clause in its policy that is very vague and can be interpreted anyway by whomever reads it saying, it is my property. The point is, it's our son's truck willed to him by his grandfather who passed away and the law says he cannot insure or title it in his name. We have tried to explain this to USAA. They just don't get it. The clause is there so you can't sue yourself or try and scam on the insurance company. We feel since our van has full coverage, I backed into his truck (which is his and by law, he cannot have his own insurance or be titled in his name and his real father would not put his name on any of the paperwork, so his real mother which is my wife had to be on it), USAA should make an exception to this clause and pay to fix the truck. We have argued this with them till we cannot argue anymore. We cannot afford an attorney and USAA knows this. I have read their value and ethic and commitment statement and they are so willing to help their loyal customers in any situation and go above and beyond. I have not seen this happen or do we see it happening. It is a catch-22 deal and we are stuck. Yes, I am angry and very dissatisfied with USAA. Thank you for your time.",1558

The representative showed me the advantages to having it and bundling with auto policy to receive discount on premium cost. She asked brief questions and suggested additional computer coverage with an additional fee. I explained I also had a storage unit where I stored my tools, computer parts and test equipment. She said this was covered as well. I bought both policies and paid 6 months premiums in advance. I work on computers to generate a little income to supplement my disability. I was getting auto insurance on a vehicle they just helped me find and finance so was easier so as could pick up vehicle that same day.  I have been so impressed w/ USAA and wanted all my business with them so to have insurance with seem a no brainer. I got the car and for the first time in 2 years had a dependable car I could drive around, shop, visit friends, and etc. I stopped by my storage Easter morning. I had bought some used furniture from friends and they met me there delivering furniture but there was a strange lock on my unit. I called storage facility and they had a maintenance man on property who came over and said did not look like one of their locks. General Manager was notified and came out, verified it was not their lock so I ask if he could cut it for me and at that time I noticed dead bolt lock had been pried open. When padlock was cut, I entered noticing all my tools and test equipment, televisions, etc had been stolen, roughly $8,000-$10,000 in value or more. I immediately called the police who came and made a police report with photos taken. I was issued a case number and was to follow up that week with any details to add to it with a detective. I went to USAA online to file the claim and get a claim check list .I called back Monday morning and was advised that an investigator was going to notify me and he did so setting up a meeting at the storage unit. I also had the former manager of the storage facility to meet us there but was told he wanted to speak to me alone so I asked former manager to please wait. I thought investigator was to assist police in helping me reclaim my lost property. Instead he said before I turn on my recorder, no harm has been done to this point and we can walk away, no harm, no foul and pretend this never happened, or an amnesty if you will. I was totally shocked and angry at the implied and was hurt by the accusation that I told him to turn the recorder on and hear the facts of my theft that had taken place. He never spoke with the police or with the former storage manager and left. I spoke with Judy ** in the claims department who advised me to make a list of the items stolen and assign value to them with description. I told her I would and it would take a while because I had a lot of tools and had to do it by memory. I also suffer from PTSD and this was very distressing to me so I had to take my time. I explained all the owner's manuals and etc. were in the cabinet along with my drill bits, Dremel bits, router bits and etc. So I had no help in trying to remember all what was there. 10-15 years accumulation of all the items. Then was informed I needed proof of my loss. I asked if sworn affidavits from friends and family would work and was told no, they would be willing to lie and cheat for me. I produced my list to the best of my memory and got prices. I emailed those in and following day, I called to see what else I could do to assist claim. Ms. Judy informed me she had already forwarded it to claims and then to legal dept. for possible actions, but nothing was need anyway for claim was not going to be paid anyway.  I held my anger. This was the 2nd time by this organization to accuse me or imply of some legal wrongdoing, not to mention all my friends and family were liars and cheats. I received the claims denied letter in roughly 4-5 days with the reason being I had failed to provide proof of loss in the form of receipts, etc. I have some receipts and affidavits of the existence and magnitude of the quantity of tools and etc. on the loss but was not given chance to provide them. If you want to get renter's insurance and are a disabled veteran, contact USAA, pay your premiums so they can accuse you of fraud, forgery and legal action if you ever try and file a claim with them. I guess best defense is good offense. I am consulting and proceeding with legal actions against them for I have called superiors and complained and explained what has happened and story validity was checked and I was told to follow up with a supervisor. I did so with 3 phone calls none of which were returned.

"1568",41939.95,"ROSS","Vista","CA",1,"auto",33.147456,-117.136349,"25 Year Member Reports: USAA has CHANGED. BEWARE and ready to fight FRAUD! I have paid hefty premiums for auto, home, life, and umbrella policies to USAA for over 25 years. My family had a claim about 15 years ago and USAA faithfully took care of us. Things have changed. Recently, my car was hit from behind, nearly killing me. The driver, also insured with USAA, was speeding and didn't see my stopped car in the fast lane or the other 3 he totaled because he was looking down at his radio, more likely, he was texting. He hit my stopped compact car in excess of 75 mph, totaling my car and others around me. I was rushed to the emergency room and treated for multiple broken bones, hands, neck, back, ribs, legs, concussion, contusions, and other injuries, which eventually resulted in surgery, and wiped me out of work for over a year. The very first thing USAA did was commit complete FRAUD in the adjustment of my vehicle. They hired an outside appraisal company, CCC One, who did an appraisal, which magically came back at nearly half the blue book value of my car. USAA tried to take advantage of my severe medical injuries and pushed me very hard to accept this settlement. I pushed back and eventually was able to secure a copy of the appraisal. I was shocked when I found out that the comparable vehicles which they used were salvage vehicles. Mine was a limited edition, registered show car that had been one of the most cherished in the local club for this vehicle. Mine was MINT new and had previously been one of the ones they keep inside the glass room next to the dealer sales desk. I explained this to USAA, but it didn't matter, they insisted that KBB was incorrect and the appraisal was the answer. I took the appraisal and ran each VIN number thru AutoFax where I discovered that they were salvage and flood vehicles. I sent the reports back to the USAA adjuster, who continued to insist that KBB was inaccurate.  I escalated this to management and even told them that I would accept the same make, model, mileage car on my driveway in lieu of their proposed settlement. There was not a single vehicle available nationwide at the price they were forcing on me. I reported the FRAUD and the manager agreed to have CCC One run the appraisal again. After much growling and threatening, I got the report and I once again found out they committed FRAUD. This time, they obscured the VIN numbers so that I could not run an AutoFax. I was able to locate the appraisal vehicles using dealership, mileage, year and color. I verified that each comparable was either a completely different vehicle than mine (like comparing a BMW base model hard top 325i to an M3 convertible) OR it was a vehicle that had been in a collision. It took me over 40 phone calls and letters to get the fair market value (still less than KBB) for my vehicle out of USAA. The process took nearly 6 months. They have never apologized for the FRAUD their hired gun, CCC One, committed. Next up, I tried to collect from the at fault driver, a USAA insured. I sent the adjuster, who has a California minimum policy to offer me, receipts for medicals and lost wages exceeding 10 x the policy limit. It has been over a year and they refuse to send the payment. They keep asking for more information even though I have already proven special damages exceed 10x their policy. I have sent them a dozen letters and even accused the adjuster of extreme bad faith and still I have not received a penny. I am shocked that USAA would take this kind of risk (Google how to open an auto policy because of bad faith and check out California Insurance Code 790) just to have the time value of the miniscule and inevitable policy limit they owed. Next, I submitted receipts for my copays and prescriptions to my medical payments group. Surely, I thought, they would reimburse me for my out of pocket expenses. This is straight forward, right? They hired a company called Auto Injury Solutions. Auto Injury Solutions has denied every single bill I have sent them, even a bill for $3.50 for pain medication 2 days after the accident. This company has sent me over 100 letters, each one stating a reason why they cannot pay the amount due. They claim to have hired independent doctors who believe that whiplash and neck injuries do not need to be treated by a Chiropractor. I have tried to reason with the med-pay adjuster and she simply refuses to send payment, even though I have sent her thousands of dollars in photocopied receipts. She asked me for my medical records, but she sent me a medical release that states USAA IS NOT HIPPA COMPLIANT. This means that USAA has no obligation to protect my medical history; that they can sell this information to life insurance and disability companies, who can then use it to deny or limit coverage.  God knows what USAA will do with my private medical information? Would you want your neighbor knowing that you had AIDS? Or your boss knowing that your daughter had an abortion? Or your school principal knowing that your kid was in drug rehab? I find it irreprehensible that USAA takes the position that they refuse to pay a single penny on med pay without full medical records, but they refuse to protect these records like every other insurance company does and is required to do under HIPPA.  So, as it stands now, I still have received not a single penny from USAA med pay. I have been thru surgeries, have had over a dozen cortisone injections and my ICD9 and CPT codes would fill a lined sheet of paper. I recently gave in and sent USAA a 50 page ledger from my medical insurance company showing every single treatment date and diagnosis. Guess what, they still refuse to reimburse me for even $4 in pain medication. Absolutely the most and ridiculous treatment I have ever experienced. Next up: the wage earner feature of my policy, a feature that promises to pay a nominal amount of disability pay provided I am taken out of work due to an auto injury. Let me just make this short and sweet: I was denied. Yep. They refused to pay a penny until I fought them for months and months and months. Then, after months of fighting, they paid a single payment and stopped. I have sent them a continuous stream of nearly 30 FULL disability notes from orthopedic surgeons treating my bones, ligaments, tendons, nerves, and other injured body parts and USAA has turned a blind eye to all of this. I get on the phone, argue, scream, send letters to USAA threatening to contact the Insurance Commissioner, and hire a Lawyer. I get a single payment, then they stop. Please, I am urging you to research USAA, research Auto Injury Solutions, and research CCC One. Look at the over sized premiums you are paying because you are not going to get the warm, cuddly, nice treatment your father used to get from USAA. I do not endorse any insurance company and I do not work for any insurance company. The above are the facts of my experience with USAA, after paying hefty premiums for as long as I can remember.

My wife's grandparents, her family, and my family have all used USAA. I had a home loan through USAA and then started to do an auto-loan through them as well. I was planning on switching more of my accounts over to them until the following happened. I had applied for an auto-loan. The pre-approval was quick and easy. I had decided to use their car buying service through TrueCar. I eventually found a vehicle and brought in the paper to the dealership. Signed all the paperwork and brought the vehicle home. Easy, right!? This is where it goes downhill. I had called USAA the day after to just confirm the dealership sent in the paperwork and to see if it was on track for funding the dealership. Everything was fine. Then three days later, the dealership calls me and says they denied my loan. I was a bit confused. I hadn't heard from USAA about this. I called USAA up and then the lady says, ""USAA has the right to deny service - we are no longer doing business with you."" My jaw dropped. I was so confused on why?! My credit is outstanding and everything up until now has been great. I proceeded to request to speak with a manager as the current person could not answer any additional questions. She said no manager was around and it would take 24 hours to speak to a manager. I figured some mistake had been made. I told them I needed to speak to someone today as the dealership needed to know what was going on. I ended up calling again to hear the same response (that they must be reading from a screen), ""USAA is no longer doing business with you."" I was amazed at how difficult it was to speak with a manager or anyone that could tell me what was going on. I asked one representative if I could just go to the huge USAA office here in town. Once I finally reached a manager, the only way I did this was that I insisted on waiting on the phone until one was available (this took a total of 2 hours). He proceeded to help call different departments to try to understand as well. He seemed just as confused and apparently their systems don't help them. I was in tears. I ended up driving home that day and stopping in at a local credit union. They were super helpful. Pre-approved, and was able to work directly with the dealership and fund them within 24 hours (whereas USAA had been over a week and still no call from them - had to hear it from the dealership first in which case, I looked like a fool). I **finally** got a call from USAA days later - that they made a mistake and now I am a customer again! They didn't offer to help rectify the situation, didn't offer anything for all the inconvenience, didn't even say they were sorry for all the problems. It was interesting though, I had to call again the next day after all of this went down and the lady on the other end said, ""Oh, we have heard of your situation."" Almost as if some memo or otherwise went out to all the call center people on it. Nice that they sent something internally but as a customer I haven't received anything. It is hurtful most of all that my family has been a valued customer for generations and within a week I became without explanation a customer that USAA is no longer doing business with - and there was no explanation. I guess I am thankful they figured out the problem. I think they lost that personal touch they used to have. At least speaking with some veterans on my current experience with USAA. It sounds like they didn't always used to be this way - they weren't so corporate. Hope this helps someone in their decision process.",1577

I sat there for over 10 minutes listening to the lecturer go on instructing the adjusters techniques how to avoid paying claims before they noticed the open door and closed it.

Four years after that trip, the roof on our home had to be replaced due to hail damage, we waited for months for the adjuster to come. Here is the punchline! He found: A whole house fan and 7 vents to have been damaged but the roof itself wasn't. We must have head laser guided hail to nail all seven 6"" vents but not the roof. We, US consumers, are too complacent and swallow the bitter pill. The practices insurance companies practice today should be outlawed, they are set to collect premiums but not protect the consumer.

Unfortunately, as time has gone on, we have become more and more disillusioned with this bank. We have a savings account and a checking account. However, this last time that we were going to buy a car the bank wanted to charge us almost 4% interest rate. I asked why that was. My husband has a credit rating of 798 and mine is 820, plus what we retain in our checking/savings account, plus the fact that we've been with them forever--have never been overdrawn, have never been late with our cc, insurance payments or car loan payments. So, what gives?! We could not get a straight answer. So, as HORRIBLE as it is, we ended up going to a credit union that offered us 1.9% What did the credit union require from us (we felt there had to be a catch -- a $3,000 deposit, etc)? They required that each one of us open an account by depositing $1 (ONE DOLLAR). I asked how on earth they determined what Apr they would allow us, and the answer was, ""your credit rating; we see that you've had excellent credit and that's all we need to base it on."" HOW ON EARTH can I be with a bank for over 20 years, never be overdrawn, have held more car loans than I can remember, paid insurance, and credit cards, without ever being late, and yet the best USAA could do for me is near 4%; while another banking institution, as stated above, who we have no history with, trust us more!!! Disappointing to say the least! In addition, a lady hit our car (no license), and I had witnesses that I was stopped when she hit me. Yet, the other lady's insurance placed me at fault! When we called USAA, they said that no we weren't at fault, but that the other insurance had deemed we were so they must have listed it as such. What would USAA do for us to help us; fight for us? NOPE! Basically they said ""Oh well, it's just the way it is and there's not much that we as customers can do about it."" WTH do we have insurance for then? So, even with witnesses there is an accident on my record in which I'm at fault because my insurance would do NOTHING to help me! Now, I have friends who work there, and they absolutely LOVE this bank, and as they've told me stories about their company parties and picnics, I can see why! Chicago (the band) was paid to come and play at one of their parties, along with many other perks!

My premiums have nearly doubled since the hurricanes that mostly didn't affect me where I am inland and on high ground and I was feeling they would just as soon I move on, demanding I fix a roof that showed water damage a year after hurricane lifted my vent cap and when the winds stopped, the cap came back down, but unbeknownst to me, nails didn't. According to roofer, it was a common occurrence after the hurricanes, but according to USAA, ""too bad, now the damage requires you immediately fix the roof or we will cancel you.""  Didn't make me feel good and I had to take out a loan to fix the roof, but ignorance did put me at fault. Now after having a new HVAC system put in and having the AC people come out twice because I felt water was coming into the hall because of it, the last big rain saw an actual flood in my hall that I figured either came in through the drainage pipe on the HVAC or a roof leak in a 4 year old roof. USAA started the claim just fine and the adjusters I was working with were helpful in telling me how to get the leak found and water mitigated, as well as a contractor to bring in for flooring replacement. The leak specialist determined the water came in through a chase pipe that actually holds the drain pipe and 2 other lines running from the outside unit to the inside HVAC closet.  The tech had not waterproofed it, so as dirt washed out of the pipe, more and more water was coming into the house, this time 8 hrs of rain gave it complete access to my house. A chase pipe is set into the foundation, so dirt covers it and the leak tech turned a hose on over it, then walked into the house to film the water coming up into the floor under the HVAC closet. It didn't take him all of 5 minutes. He told me to have the AC company waterproof it inside and out. I had hoped USAA would press the AC company to pay the damages, the way they do drivers at fault if I am hit on the road. Turns out when the claim info on the leak showed up, along with pictures I took showing them the pipe wasn't waterproofed, folks above the adjuster I was dealing with decided this wasn't a leaking pipe, it was flooding and they were not going to cover it. I don't live in a flood plain and in 35 years have never had water get into the house from rain.  The definition apparently is groundwater. All water that doesn't fall on a body of water becomes groundwater! Would it have had to fall directly into the pipe to qualify? And who did they ask if it was due to flooding - the contractor that stood to make money off both of us, had I not found another contractor for $3000 less and had been discussing how unbelievable it was that the HVAC company refused to take the blame or that USAA was thinking about not allowing the claim. Now that he wasn't going to get the job and had to tear up the check they sent him for the work, he has become the expert, though he never saw the initial damage or the leak reports! I am so tired or being pushed around by people who don't mind taking my money but have enough weight to think they can walk all over me. And if you try to sue...do they cancel you?! Is there a governmental body that oversees insurance companies?",1600

I was then offered what appeared to be a good credit card offer. I was in the market for a new credit card and the way I understood it was the CC was 0% APR on all purchases and transfers for 15 months. I even repeated it back to her and she confirmed it. I said I was interested in signing up. A couple months later I received a cc statement which included interest on it. When I called to inquire about what I thought was a mistake, I was informed that my offer was for only transfers and not purchases. I then explained that was not what the representative had told me at the beginning bc if she had, I wouldn't of signed up bc I could have gone with a different cc company and received 0% APR on purchases and transfers - But I had chosen USAA because I heard it was a good company to do business with.  I also had just received an email offer from USAA for the 0% APR on purchases AND transfers so I couldn't understand why they couldn't apply that to my current credit card? They told me no but I could open another credit card to get that offer with them. That was out of the question. I informed them I would be paying off my balance and closing my card and never using their services again, and I would be sure to let my family and friends know of my terrible experience with them. I have an excellent credit score, always pay my bills on time and typically pay off my large purchases within 6 months. I am an excellent customer to have, but I guess that's not what they are looking for bc then they don't make enough money off of me.

I went to work, had a great day at work and then left to head home to pick my daughter up to take her to the middle school basketball game where she was a cheerleader. However, only 3 minutes into my drive home, an idiot turns left off a side street directly into my car as I was coming straight down a hill at 45 mph. Yeah, she got t-boned. The impact was so great that I ended up mostly down the hill where her car spun quite a few times and laid rested most of the way up the hill. I immediately felt searing pain in my knees but I realized for the most part I seemed to be okay.  A couple of great passersby stopped, got out of their cars in the cold freezing rain to see if we were both ok. Police arrived. One ambulance arrived and my husband showed up 10 minutes later. The firemen asked if I was okay and at this point, the pain in my knees and neck was really setting in but they stated it’d be another 10 minutes before they got another ambulance but since my husband had just shown up, I could ride to the ER with him since it was like half a mile away.  We get there and pain is just shooting up and down my spine. As soon as the ER doctor hears, I’ve had a spinal fusion. 2 metal rods, 10 screws and 5 brackets were placed in my back previously. He immediately puts a collar on me. They do all the x-rays and ct scans and nothing is broken. He says with having scoliosis and having a slight curve at the base of my neck, the whiplash is going to probably take longer to heal than it would for someone with a perfectly straight spine. I was on pain pills and muscle relaxers 3 times a day for 2 whole weeks before the pain started to subside. The knees were not broken. I could walk but they were bruised for almost 2 months.  We notify USAA. The driver of the car was ticketed, no valid license and improper lane usage causing an accident. Still USAA charged us the $500 deductible even though she was ticketed. They gave us a rental and said they'd pay us for my car since it was totaled. They took possession of my car within a few days, told me I had to send the title to them before they would issue payment. It was paid off. I send them the title. We wait and hear nothing. We keep trying to call Gloria S., our claims contact through USAA, and kept getting her voicemail and she wouldn’t return calls. So they have my car, have the title and still haven't sent payment for it. I have to return the rental. My car was paid off. I was waiting for them to pay me off so I could purchase another car without having to obtain another loan. So now time is up on the rental and, of course, we could keep it longer if we paid for it. So my husband used his truck as a trade in so I could get a vehicle to get me back and forth to work. So he had no vehicle and had to ride with coworkers.  It was 23 days from the accident before they paid us. They stated they had to prove the other driver was at fault driver and they would reimburse the $500. I sent them the copy of the accident report, I even highlighted all the areas since apparently they don’t have anyone employed intelligent enough to comprehend reading a police report and they still have not paid us back. Also, they refuse to go after the owner of the vehicles insurance. The lady driving wasn't the owner, the owner let her drive his car knowing she wasn’t on his policy and his insurance First Chicago stated to USAA they were going to deny the claim stating their insured didn’t allow her to drive the vehicle therefore, they are not liable. What does USAA do? Nothing!  I was out of work for 3 days an additional day to find a **** car at the last minute because I had to return the rental. They stated 2 days after the accident it was a total loss and it took 21 days after that to receive payment. I still have not received compensation for time off work, pain and suffering and tons of undue stress from USAA, the owner’s insurance and the retarded driver who caused the accident. In this whole ordeal, we have faithfully had USAA many years as my husband is active duty air force.  It’s deducted monthly from our account. My car again was paid off. I didn’t even have to carry full coverage on it but I did because we are responsible and just in case something like this would happen and it did and there has been nothing but run around since then. Not once did USAA initiate any calls to us. We had to call over and over and email before we'd get a hold of Gloria S. and they also had the audacity to ask us when we first called to report the claim. “Well sir do you want us to go after the other driver or do you want to handle that on your own?”  We have been paying for full coverage insurance for? Isn’t that your **** job? I’m going to press this issue and not let it drop until I am satisfied USAA and my claims adjustor Gloria S. are held accountable for how they treat their clients. If anyone else has come across complete and udder disregard while filing a claim through USAA contact me at my email address. I plan to compile lots of complaints and go to anyone who will listen, attorney, news, etc. My husband has given the last 16 years to the military.

I purchased a 2008 Honda Element to replace my totaled vehicle, and got a quote for my ""new"" vehicle.

USAA sold my mortgage to OCWEN shortly after the accident and I began receiving bills in the mail clearly reading ""Auto and Property Insurance"". I was led to believe by customer service representatives that my homeowners insurance was no longer part of my escrow, but now combined with my monthly auto insurance bill.

After joining in 1991, we were so impressed with our initial interaction with USAA, we moved all our financial products over to USAA except for our investments. For the first 10 15 years, the service was excellent and we were willing to pay a little more since their service was so outstanding. Then gradually over time, their customer service has been gradually degrading. Maybe this is due to them growing to fast, or maybe their target customer base has changed, we're not sure. For approximately the past 5 years, the changes we've noticed are: long hold times on the phone; often times being transferred on the phone multiple times for 1 question/issue and sometimes being cutoff; customer service reps who want to explain a lot of details and tell you a whole bunch of information before they listen so they understand your specific question/need; and speaking with 3 different people in the same area asking the exact same question and receiving 3 different answers. Heres two examples. Last January, I wanted a new car. NFCUs process was far faster and easier, their customer service staff were better to deal with, and NFCUs rate was lower. I got the car and a few weeks later, someone drove by my parked unoccupied car and hit it, and took the mirror off while I was getting a haircut. The driver came in, told me what happened and gave me his insurance info. On the way home I called USAA and the customer service rep I spoke with gave me such a long explanation of the process, I couldn't understand it despite telling her to keep simple short and to the point. I had her transfer me to someone else and that person was just as bad. I called the guys insurance company and they said go get a written quote, fax or email it, and as long as the price is not exceedingly high, well cut you a check.  The next afternoon, I drove to the dealer, got a written estimate emailed to me while still at the dealer, emailed it to the guy at the other insurance company while still at the dealer, called the insurance guy, and he put a check in the mail that night just as I was driving away from the dealer. I called the dealer back on the way home and told them to order the part and I was back at the dealer in 3 days and had my new mirror installed and had already received the check in the mail. At the same time, USAA is calling back a few days later after the new mirror was installed asking do you still want us to file a claim for this? Yesterday, I noticed online my annual renewal for my motorcycle insurance 2 months ago went up 22%- no accidents, tickets or other changes. I use Progressive who is a USAA partner since USAA does not insure motorcycles. I called Progressive and they state it's due to a statewide increase the rates go up and down ever year. We also have umbrella insurance through USAA for our home, autos, and motorcycle. So I do some research and looks like Progressive's customer service ratings are not good and Geico is very good. So I call Geico and they state the WI rates went up 9% two months ago and I get a quote from them for the same insurance and its 37% less. I call Progressive back and tell them about the call the day before and WI rates went up 9%, not 22%, then they state my credit score dropped a little bit (still over the 90th percentile) due to some credit reports being pulled and that accounted for the other 13% increase. We have never paid one bill late, and I got a new car, refied the house and did a few other things triggering the credit report requests over the past year. So I called USAA to inquire about the required minimum amounts on the bike to keep the umbrella policy and I am on hold for over 45 minutes, talk to 3 people, and get completely different answers. One person spent over 10 minutes reading the policy and still was not sure if I could switch to another company without losing the umbrella policy. I told her to transfer me to someone else who could answer this basic question then I was back on hold for 10 minutes. The second person stated if I switch, USAA will drop the umbrella policy and the third person tells me if I switch, USAA could drop me. Then on the required coverages and minimum amounts to maintain the umbrella policy, I get three completely different answers as well. So I called Geico and took out the new insurance and called Progressive and cancelled that policy. I spoke with 3 different people from Geico and they were all very knowledgeable and helpful. My next steps are to start researching other companies with excellent customer service and move all my USAA polices to other companies. As a final comment, the customer service on the USAA home loan was terrible as was the experience trying to refinance with USAA twice in the last year. Since the car loan went so well with NFCU, I refied the house with NFCU, saved $450 a month, and we were very impressed with that service so one less policy/account to move.

We exchanged information and she told me that she would be contacting her insurance right away. I got home about an hour after the accident and called her insurance myself and she had not made in contact with them. I gave all the information and they said that they would send out an appraiser to look at my car. Three days later, the appraiser came out and then I went to call USAA back. At that point, I had to leave message after message with no call backs from them. Finally, I received a voice mail from the lady who took my call on the first day stating that they have not made in contact with the insured (Apparently, the driver lied and hadn't contacted her insurance company) and I don't even know how many times they even try. I was informed that they would be sending out legal letters to her if they could not make contact by phone. And if they did not contact her through letters, she would be uninsurable and be dropped from their company. By then, my claim ""might be denied,"" which also means ""will be denied."" How are people getting away with this? There really should be a police officer coming out to every accident (in Dallas, Texas, they won't unless you are clinging to life after a car wreck) but things need to change. This is ridiculous and I take her inability to call her insurance company as a sign of guilt. They kept telling me to file through my insurance and my insurance tells me to wait on them. And if I file through them, my rates will go up and I have to pay my deductible. Insurance, flat out, is a scam but USAA seems to be the worst since dealing with their insured's accident of rear ending me. Now, when I talk to them, I get rude responses and attitude. What a horrible company. Nevertheless, I am still waiting to see what plays out as it has only been three weeks. I even filed a drivers crash report with the Texas Department of Transportation.

I personally have served as critical family support to one deployed husband at one time and another who was a recruiter in two separate branches. I've been a customer of USAA, paying for Auto insurance, renters insurance, a checking account for over 6 years and three years ago, added an auto loan. I called USAA recently after I received a letter advising me that due to no fault of my own, and simply for living in Texas, my rates were going up. On the call, the rep reiterated that I had an excellent driving record that my rates were going up for reasons unknown other that I lived in Texas. This is offensive and unacceptable to me. But while I was shopping for better insurance, I decided to upgrade my car. I have very good credit and have demonstrated 3 years of excellent payment history with USAA with one exception. I was hurt badly and spent time in the hospital and that ONE month I was 30 days late. ONE TIME in three years. Over 30, times, I paid OVER the amount and early, but that was not given ANY weight in determining the loan percentage rate. We had a terrible hail storm recently in the DFW area and I filed the claim with USAA, also my insurance company. They did process the claim quickly, but it took a WEEK to get the money from USAA to my Capital One checking account. USAA insurance put the money in pretty quickly, but the checking is deplorable! Antiquated, sluggish, excessive ridiculous unnecessary hoops I had to jump through just to get the money from MY USAA Checking account to MY Capital One account. In this financial environment, with as many security features that I have to clear just to log into my account, that is just ridiculous and frustrating. It put my new car purchase in jeopardy, as that was the down payment for my new vehicle. When I spoke to USAA about extending me another loan, I was just plain pissed with what they came back with. 3 years ago I was rebuilding my credit so the 13.5% rate was reasonable. 3 years late, with all problems corrected and removed, I now have excellent credit and when USAA offered me a loan at 13.75% I literally told them articulately what I thought. I was able to get a below 5% rate with the dealership BTW. THAT is how USAA treats its loyal customers. Insurance: Raises your rates for no reason. Auto Loan: Give you the worst possible interest rate. Checking: Make it incredibly difficult to get your money. And the grand finale: I just got a call from the place that did the appraisal on my hail damage... USAA just sent them a check for the exact same amount I had to fight to get from my OWN checking account.

Now... the entire state of NC was in a state of emergency from Oct. 2016 - Jan. 31, 2017 because of the damage it had sustained and recovery process. In that time frame EVERYONE was pardoned from late fees and cancellations because of the state of emergency given by the governor. Somehow, USAA said I was late for payment and sent a cancellation notice to me in the middle of February??? Now... I'm not a genius, but, they're gonna send me a cancellation notice for the same month that we were physically in??? WOW!!! CRAAAZY!!! I guess my 18 years as a customer did not deserve any reconsideration of the fact. So... I go to pay my Feb. 2017 bill on the phone and ask about the pay in full status and cancellation. Well USAA did what USAA always does... ""sir policy this policy that"", blah, blah, blah. ""We provide a service that we expect to get paid for.""  So I mentioned, why couldn't I keep my rental for the 30 days/$50 a day $1500 max when my claim was in process. She explained to me, ""As soon as your vehicle was deemed a total loss due to the flood, you then only have 7 days for the rental vehicle from that point due to another policy that have."" So in total I only had my rental car 9 DAYS. So I explained, ""So basically, I pay for full coverage on my vehicles (that's paid off), but I can't exercise my right to use those options because of ANOTHER POLICY???"" She said, ""Yes sir."" I was ghost pepper hot!  So now... the USAA rep is giving me an ultimatum to Pay In Full for my next 6 mos. or refusing service to me. I said, ""You're not gonna tell me what I NEED to do with my money... It's not wise to tell a former or active military member what they are GOING to do and take away their options, you must be out your damn mind."" I told her, ""I rather pay double the amount to someone else with better service, than to be cornered like a dog."" So... that's exactly what I did. I dropped USAA before the new policy term and now I'm with Geico.  Reason for picking Geico, my mother has them, and I was able to see firsthand how quickly they responded to their customers after the flood. They were literally the first auto insurance on scene. Geico was sending reps from out of state to help flood victims here locally. Plus they let her keep her rental car 40 days no extra charge because she had lost her vehicle as well. So it gave her ample time to look for another vehicle. USAA on the other hand took 2 days to respond just to get the initial paperwork started. I guess that's what they call service.  I would definitely not be going back to USAA. Sad thing is, I use to vouch for USAA for the longest time irregardless of the stories you would hear... especially being in a military town, you would hear bad remarks about USAA, ""ALL THE TIME""... not anymore. 18 years man... and they didn't give two cents about customer loyalty. LEAVE NOW before you invest too much in a company that doesn't care. You've been warned!",1650

Their minimum payment wasn't high enough on my CD secured credit card for the interest on the card made making my balance go over my limit. ""Their"" set minimum. So their set regulated minimum payment should have been higher to offset that. But they set the minimum and I was paying it automatically out of my account their own bank. I did not know this was going on until I called them with another problem with my checking account and during the call I asked them about how to up the payment amount on my card so I could pay it off faster. I had tried a couple of times earlier but it was so hidden in their website I could not find it. At that point they notified me that that card had been Closed. They could not see why as I payed it every month out of my USAA checking Automatically and they said the one time I was a day or so late they said that would have not closed it. She sent me supervisor and it went up and up and up the chain to Executive Resolution. They all agree that that should not have been closed. They said they would have to investigate it further and would call me back. Well that phone call was over an hour long and I had to call 7 more times over 8 months and the same things happened. I nobody helped me. They all lied to me wasted my time. Said they would call back, did so, I was by the phone - their game is to let it ring and then hang up so by the time you answer you have a missed call but it shows on their end that they tried to call. So After more than Seven hours of angering phone calls wasting my time away from my Job. They did not end up doing anything to resolve their mistake.

Today I called to change the date those payments come out of my account... and they told me I could not! Because the card was closed! Right now I am seething! I Told them the whole story again. It's all in the notes. I told them I don't deserve to be treated this way after 19 years and having car insurance sometimes on 3 cars + Renters Insurance + Banking 1 + Credit Card. Today they said the same thing after being on the phone with them for over an hour and seething agree, I told them am going to sue and also for suffering through all this jerking around they did to me. THEN ALL OF THE SUDDEN SOMEONE SAID - ""Oh I see here you were late one time for two months""!!! that is a Flat out Lie!!! I got that card to improve my credit and I would not have done that and did not do that and every person out of 7 calls and seven hours and probably like 35 people never said that until I ""Threatened""! to sue. They said it was my fault and that they can clearly see it. The girl today said ""Oh I was just looking at this year 2016 but this happened back in 2015. I didn't go back that far."" BULL. This whole thing started with my call for almost a year, and EVERY person probably out of 35 people I talked to as it went up the chain of supervisors, every time.

This one-sided relationship simply cannot continue, it is obviously about receiving premiums, customers do not matter to USAA. There was an accident on May 15, 2015, in which we were NOT AT FAULT. USAA has courted the other parties while ignoring its own insured. We have attempted to resolve all issues, to no avail. Fair warning, USAA is not to be trusted, they will side with every party except their own, leaving discovery up to the insured instead of doing their job and taking care of its policyholders, upstanding service personnel. Not to mention, the accident in which we were not involved, USAA set up an INVESTIGATOR to investigate us, although the other party admitted fault and was operating with a suspended driver's license and failed to yield the right of way. We were not allowed to speak to adjusters until USAA ""completed its investigation."" Even now, everything has gone horribly wrong and we are still at TOTAL LOSS of peace, happiness, a 3-week old 2015 brand new vehicle, the trade-in 2015 vehicle and all down payment funds, vehicle fees and registration, personal effects, pain, suffering, emotional distress, etc. USAA paid PAT PECK NISSAN, the dealership because they never transferred title and ""owned"" our vehicle. USAA violated our privacy by discussing our policy with a third party not listed on our policy, without our express permission. Pat Peck Nissan, the dealership who supposedly provided a replacement vehicle, (the total loss car) according to Mississippi Lemon Law because the trade-in vehicle was the lemon. Pat Peck Nissan received close to $34,000 for a vehicle that was sold to us, USAA did that too. Buyer beware, USAA only exists to collect premiums, not take care of legally binding claims.",1688

From what my husband has told me, and what I understand, USAA Automobile Insurance policies can be paid in several ways, such as annually, biannually, and so forth, allowing the consumers multiple options in which to pay for their automobile insurance coverage.  In today's economy, having such options as these available, can greatly influence the consumer's decision when it comes to choosing the provider of their automobile insurance coverage. USAA also allows for the bundling of other insurance plans and coverage, for things such as Homeowners Insurance, Flood Insurance, etcetera, which makes choosing USAA coverage even more desirable over some of the other insurance providers. One stop shopping is a win for all parties involved, and I believe it is highly beneficial in helping reduce costs, and in keeping insurance premiums down.

Then they go on to say something that completely negates the previous statement. When I point it out, they just repeat themselves, and change what they said, only later to return to the original statements. It is completely ridiculous for an insurance company bill, or any bill, for that matter, to be so long winded and utterly confusing. Period. My bill was explained to me to be $7 a month to store my vehicle. This is what they told me when I cancelled my policy to switch to a non-driving one. They also said I had over paid and that it would be 2 months until I needed to pay again because of the forwarding credit. I had it clearly explained to me several times, and I even wrote it on my calendar when the next bill was due. This is because I would be out of town for a month with my school. When I returned, there was a bill waiting for me. The woman I spoke with, Anne, said she would fix it, restarts the policy or something, and said it was fixed, back to around $7 a month. My next bill was $6.50. I paid it. This month it was $14. No matter how hard they tried, they came up with no explanation that made any sense as to why I now owed $14. The manager even said that I didn't even owe the $6.50, that it was overpayment. I said I received a bill for that amount and so I paid it. He said there was no record of that bill, so I overpaid. Yet somehow I owed $14 on a $7 a month bill that I overpaid! When asked for an explanation, he said that I had a 6 month policy at $7 a month. Blah, blah, blah.  And that they did me a favor and did not charge me for the first 2 months as a new policy courtesy, and that I was now paying for it.And I said, no, you are not doing me a favor, I paid for those 2 months with a balance forward. Which he changed the subject to my current bill reflecting the next 3 months. So I said, then when you cancel my policy this week, I will get some money back, since this bill reflects the next 3 months. He said, no that bill is for this month only. I said ""you just said it was for 3 months!” He went back to his 6 month explanation. Then he said that when I sold the car in a few days, they would cancel it and credit me the leftover amount?! When he tried to tell me again that USAA did me a courtesy not charging me for the first 2 months, I said, yeah, but you are charging me now unexpectedly, and that is no favor.

He said I'll transfer over and we got disconnected. At this point I had spent 30-45 minutes on the phone. I gave up. I felt like the runaround would just continue. Today when I cancelled, they said I still owe $8 that is leftover from the previous policy. How can that be! I get a different story from every person I talk to, and none of what they say is on a paper trail that I get to follow. And probably not for anyone else, either. Not trustworthy. A bill should never look like that or change without notice. A bad insurance company, if you value predictable bills or your time.

They never paid stating that I never filled out the paperwork. I have post office receipts as well as signature confirmation.  My insurance company is still fighting them to get reimbursed. All the while, I am thinking that it is now between the insurance companies. I was wrong in my assumption, the remaining hospital balance was sent to collections and shows negative on my credit report. Maybe if they would have left one person in charge of my case, instead of switching it every other day then they would have been able to keep up with the paperwork. How can a company claiming to represent our freedom fighting morally ethical military, be so unscrupulous and morally corrupt? Fast forward, current day. My husband was rear ended 2 weeks ago by a man with USAA (urghhh) insurance. The other driver admitted fault and police report was taken. Adjuster comes out Monday. We haven't heard a single thing since Monday and it is now Thursday. We tried calling numerous times, but can never get in touch with anyone. We are down to one car to take and pick up children and commute to 3 jobs. They will not approve a rental car until the claim has been approved.

I have never opened or been a co-applicant on any banking or checking account for USAA. In May I received a notice forwarded from an address I left one year ago. Sixty days prior to leaving I had all mail forwarded to a post office box at my new address. The information I received from USAA was dated April 2016 sent to my previous address and forwarded to the new address I've had on file for a year. It stated my checking and debit card was overdrawn by more than $8K and was being sent to collections.  I was confused as to how, first the outstanding debt could be forwarded to my new address but not the cards I suppose to have used. I telephoned USAA on at least six separate occasions and was told something different each time. I was finally shared that USAA realized it was a fraudulent account and would not go further on making me liable for the amount owed. It took an additional ninety days for this information to be shared. I then requested to receive a letter from USAA to that effect and stating I have never opened an account...INSTEAD I received a letter with the checking and debit card account in my name.

I served in the US Army and Army Reserves and thought banking with USAA was going to work for me and my family. I've processed finances on a regular basis, transfers between all my USAA accounts savings and checking with no problems until this past month. When doing a funds transfer in April between 2 USAA checking accounts, the funds moved the day I did the transfer but at the end of ""their business day"", the funds moved back. Problem with this idea the funds left the one account and posted to the other. It could visibly be seen that it posted processing the transfer. Their business day processing and on their ""employee only"" screens showed the funds still in the first account.  I processed bill payments in the amounts of $1300.00 from the other account that transfer credited. After 3 days when all was processed, I went back online to verify balances knowing what payments have processed. USAA had processed the transfers again pulling from a positive balanced account making the checking account negative by $1300.00 plus charging overdraft fees and returning checks making the negative balance increase. They returned checks that the funds were available to pay making me have to go to my children's school and explain and pay them in cash for products.  My spouse's payroll deposit was deposited to the other checking account which is not attached to the negative checking account USAA transferred his deposit to partially clear the negative balance returning any automatic bill payments set to clear from his pay leaving us with nothing in any accounts we hold even pulling from our children's accounts. We started getting calls from their collections resolutions department looking to clear the negative balance. They left messages but when returning their calls, they didn't answer. When asked questions to the collections department, they seem to only be able to see one account but can move money out of all accounts. They then offer to help by advising me that I can apply for loans and credit cards to clear the account not releasing the payroll check that was pulled from my other checking account without my authorization. They are willing to claim they are here to help all military families but yet helping us to go further in debt with their fraudulent actions and policies.

On 12/15/09, I tried accessing USAA and was getting an error message saying a ""system error"". I tried again the next day and still the same thing. I called my daughter to see if she was experiencing any problems logging in, and she said no. So, I called USAA and I explained my problem. I was connected to the supervisor who handles the online service. She explained to me that because of our bankruptcy 7 or so years ago, our access to the account has been limited. I just could not believe that after all these years. What? Did they just wake up?  It's like we are criminals because we filed bankruptcy. Filing does not make you a bad person, but evidently, USAA thinks so. And over the years, we have been discriminated for other things also. Like with USAA, you can scan a check and deposit it directly from home. Evidently, USAA thinks we may scan a bad check or something because we weren't allowed to do this. So, after having had enough abuse over the years regarding our bankruptcy, I decided it was time to move on. I have obtained new auto insurance with another company, which by the way is cheaper than USAA, and I have opened another checking account with another bank and plan on severing ties with USAA.

"1757",41107.16,"TERRAN","Tucson","AZ",1,"homeowners",32.1547412181818,-111.174343654545,"I received a letter about 1.5 months ago from USAA stating a home inspection was needed. I PCS'd 2.5 years ago after being reactivated to the military and have leased out my home. Last year, I received the same letter from USAA and when I said it would be too intrusive to a new set tenants that were just in the process of moving in, they said a drive by would be sufficient. Then we got this letter again, this time, an inspector contracted by USAA called a month and a half later and told us the inspection would take 2-3 hours! I was taken aback by the length and unknown reason for this inspection. He said the time was due to the level of detailed information USAA was requesting, i.e. interior picture documentation, interior measurements and determination of structure construction, etc.  It sounded to me like all the things that were available on the original home appraisal and tax records, and building cost estimates are readily available to track changes from the original insurance estimate. So, I asked the inspector to also be provided a copy of what he sends to USAA. He replied, ""Sorry, I work for USAA. You'll have to contact them about that."" This sounds very intrusive to ask of my tenant, especially since I do not know what the purpose of the inspection is. I have been a customer of USAA for more than 30 years. During this time, the company had earned my trust and loyalty, so I tried to be cooperative. I also come from a long military family background where our combined experience with the company is over 150 years. So trying to be cooperative, yet suspicious, I asked the inspector to put this in an email to me with some proposed dates and I would send his email along with a scanned copy of USAA's letter and a cover requesting support from my tenant, so this inspection could be coordinated and accomplished.  Our discussion took place around 5PM and he sent me an email shortly afterward that evening, but stated now that his calendar had booked up, that he only had one day and one time available. We put him in touch with our tenant directly, who asked for the inspection to be rescheduled to 1st week of August instead of 3rd weekend of July as they are traveling out of town during that time. The inspector said, ""Sorry that won't do, we must get in contact with USAA."" My tenant owns a large business and has multiple insurance policies and called this out to me, stating he has never ran across this before. Makes you think the insurance company is casing out the house. I called USAA, said I am not doing anything differently and this inspection comes out of the blue for an unknown reason. Then, I commented on the length of time this would take and the inspector's inflexibility, and requested this be rescheduled. Still, I asked them why. I understand that when you purchase a home, an insurance inspection makes sense to appropriately document for coverage purchases and to get an idea of replacement costs etc., even a drive by occasionally to check the condition. But really, 4 years after purchase? They would know if anything was wrong, a claim would exist. I told them that I do a thorough walk through inspection with my tenants, including pictures and written checklists that we both signed during beginning and end of leases.  The current tenants have only been in the house for ~3 months and I would be happy to share this formally documented information. I have owned ~5 homes, last one for 10 years and have never had this issue. Something has changed at USAA. I am highly suspicious of a hidden agenda, rate increase, dropping insurance, finding something they could exclude in the future, let your imagination take you there. The USAA agent hesitated, thinking of what to say, then told me that our home values have increased and this inspection is to adequately check the value of our home. This is counter intuitive in today's economic, employment and housing environment. I have had 2 appraisals on my home and track current values. In fact, my current resident is a builder, leasing our home while building his own custom home 2 doors down in my neighborhood.  I live in an exclusive manned gated community. I can answer the question directly. I am satisfied with my current level of coverage and believe I am adequately insured for the replacement value of my home. I have an inside track to what is being built in the neighborhood. I feel that USAA is using bullying tactics that show a mistrust of current long term customers and I hate to say it, but this is making me think of going elsewhere for my auto and home insurance needs and encouraging the same from brothers, sisters, father and children. This tactic will inherently backfire and cost USAA far more in company brand equity and customer loyalty (affecting the bottom line) more than they realize.  The competitors a.k.a. Geico and others have ramped up marketing campaigns and sponsorships, targeting USAA customers at practically every major military event and is nipping at their heels. Once customer and the brand loyalty is lost, kiss it goodbye. The piss off factor is large, especially if as I suspect, the true hidden agenda is only one-sided - raise my rates to increase company revenues with no value added proposition. My question is, what do I get out of this for the ** pain? I am finding it difficult to make excuses to my current tenants for the behavior of my insurance company. I'm waiting to see what they'll come back with for rescheduling and the ""why"" again.",1757

I recommended we move our vehicles to the side road to avoid someone else hitting us, and noticed, and apparently as driving, she was on the phone.  The damage was minimal (or so I thought). Police were not called as I thought this was a minor accident and no need in dragging police off for something so small... let them be busy catching real criminals. We exchanged information, her father showed up, took pictures... assured me USAA will be in touch with me the next day.

My problems started when I purchased a new property that had a run down barn on it. Right off the bat I disclosed that the barn was in poor shape and it was my intention to tear it down. At that time they said no problem. After 3 no shows from an inspector they sent, she finally showed up and some time later I received notice that if my barn was not torn down by the end of March they would cancel my policy. Since it was November and I live in Indiana, where we have winter, I called them and ask for an extension. I was told that come March I would receive notice of cancellation but all I needed to do was contact them then and I would be given an extension.  I contacted them but was told I had six months that was plenty of time. I tried to explain to this lady, living in Texas, what winter in Indiana was like and there was no way that a large farm barn could be torn down during that time due to weather but she did not care. Roll the clock on a few months and I logged onto my account to find my auto insurance was cancelled. When I inquired why, I learned that a transfer from my other bank account did not go through, fair enough that wasn't USAA's issue but I did ask why I wasn't contacted and they claimed I was. I said ""No I wasn't."" I received no email or Postal service mail. The representative was helpful and had me redo my email notification setup. I paid the late balance and reestablished my auto insurance. Shortly after the next bill became due I checked my online account and I was cancelled again with no notification.  I called and inquired why again the money did not transfer from my other account but this time I was sure there was plenty of money available. The representative told me since the last transfer did not go through it cancelled the auto draft. I was never told that was the case even when I was discussing it with them the first time. I ask again why I wasn't notified and was told again that I was, so I said ""Let's explore this further because something is wrong with my notifications."" The USAA Representative was again very nice and helpful and did some test with my account by sending me a notification which did not send me an email. She stated they had been having some IT issues and this needed to be forwarded to the web people. A couple of days later the web person contacted me and when I explained the problem she stated that wasn't in their area of service. I was unable to contact anyone who could help me. Back to the second cancellation I was very upset about it and told the representative that I was going to find insurance elsewhere. She talked me out of it and took my money by credit card. USAA cancelled my insurance anyway but since I did not receive notification I was unaware until two weeks later when I went to check on my account and it was locked out. Astonished they would do such a thing as lock me out of my accounts so that I could not see them to work on the issue. I called them and was told a bunch of crap like the system can't do this and the system can't do that. I was horrified that this company is 100% driven by the ""system."" There was nothing people could do because the computer said this. Problem is the ""system"" is messed up! I have spent countless hours on the phone since trying to resolve all of these issues but no matter what the representatives do the ""system"" seems to be in control and no resolution has been made. Still to this date if I try to log in I am denied and the message says I owe money. I don't believe that I owe any money but since USAA is unable to assist in this matter I have let it ride. I know that I need to get this dealt with but I have also given up on any hope that a service Representative, as nice as they might be, will be able to help in any way. I probably will have my lawyer take over from this point because I do not like the idea of them posting I owe money. One additional problem is they have no ATMs or collection centers within 50 miles of me so the only reasonable way that I can deposit money is transfer from my other account which takes 3 days. I am so disappointed that things went this way because previous to the start of these problems they were exceptional. I had two claims they paid without issue and my daughter who is a military wife had a couple of claims they were exceptional with. But there seems to be no resolution to my problems.

In this time, I filed very few claims; two for (minor) auto damage and one for food that was lost when my freezer went foul after a power outage of over three days. I've paid USAA a lot of money to cover my cars & home in case of damage, but I realize today, that it has all been a simple, but glaring scam on their part and a big joke on the consumer(me).  Unfortunately, you and I continue to allow this kind of fraud by voting politicians into office, who condone insurance fraud, ** they probably even profit from it. It isn't rocket science, so let me explain how they do it; the minute you file a claim for home damages (in my case due to severe weather/ice), the insurance company customer service person warns you by saying, well you know you have this big ($500) deductible, do you really want to do this? When you say of course, the damages are well over that amount, they will (reluctantly) send a person to your home to get an ""estimate."" This is just a smoke screen as the next step is that they call Stacie ** from the CO claims adjusters office to take on the claim and she will send an additional person (an engineer) to your house to find a reason for them not to pay you. It is that plain and that simple. You pay for insurance (your entire life), without the insurance company sending an engineer to your house to make sure your porch or home (etc) should be covered, but when you try to file a claim so you can get your home repaired, they will send the engineer to your house to find a reason so they won't have to pay you. In my book of perceptions, this is what is known as a scam and/or fraud. They are saying they offer you (the military or prior military) a service of insurance to cover possible costs due to damage, and insurance is required (by law) if you get a loan to buy your home, but when you need them to follow through on their end of the deal, they will bail on you and laugh the whole time they are doing it. Please, if you have USAA, don't think I am an exception to the rule. My daughters and her husband (retired LTC in the US Army) experienced the same thing and have since canceled them. They don't care if you cancel them either, because this is another scam. They have done their math, they know they can scam three people for every 1 person who drops them. Please, do not listen to their BS and think that their lower monthly payments are a good thing, because when you need them the most (catastrophe etc), they will be there for only one reason and that is to ** you over.

The woman proceeded to flee the scene. A police report was filed and USAA was called. Our daughter went to a doctor for pain in her neck and back a few days later. The doctor prescribed pain medication. By the way, I'm in Afghanistan. It took over 3 days to get the van towed and we were then told it was a total loss. I looked the value up in Kelly Blue Book and NADA. KBB is $5031 and NADA is $5425, with mileage taken into account. Someone named ""Ray"" called my wife and said we had a week to find a car and that they would not pay for the car rental after one week. It took them 5 days to determine it was totaled, 3 of which the vehicle was sitting at my daughters job site. The ""appraiser"" Gregg ** of CCC ONE listed the vehicle at $3555, which is way off the mark. I told USAA we were not going to settle for that amount: it wasn't our fault and we can not possibly get another vehicle for that amount. I tried for 2 hours from Afghanistan to reach the numbers listed but only got their voice mail. The Evaluation Report provided by Mr. Gregg ** showed 3 other vehicles, none of which had near the options as ours, with values listed at more than $5000 ""adjusted"" to just over $3000. One was listed at $7995 and was ""adjusted"" to $3824. Like that explained everything!? It also listed several others (all 2001 Chrysler T&C) with the very same scenario.

I wish I had did more research and read some of these reviews before I opened an account with them.

I asked to see a manager at the headquarters in San Antonio and they sat me down on a video chat with someone who was clearly not in any management position, who then directed me to the fraud department. This so called ""fraud department"" who never contacted me for an investigation decided it was my fault. Because they refuse to show me the tape of ""myself"" committing this crime, I'm just going to assume it was an inside job because the forged signature on the back of the checks matched the tellers deposit slip handwriting, not to mention the fact that my name was spelled wrong. And it just happened to be the same teller on both days these fake checks were deposited. What they won't admit is that in February of this year a woman was busted for a check fraud ring and one of the banks affected was USAA. Bank of America, and IBC was affected too but they gave the money back to their customers... but what did USAA do? They had the audacity to say it was me or someone close to me like a family member. Why would I screw myself over and furthermore WHY on earth would I use my own account information to do it? Like I said its all on tape but they said the only way the tapes could be reviewed is if I took them to court. So USAA took all funds from my savings and checking account to cover for the negative $2200.00 that was stolen, and the $900.00 that they couldn't get out of my bank accounts they turned me over to collections who have been harassing me for months. USAA makes billions off stealing money from hard working people, knowing it would be really hard to sue them. And I have called several lawyers to just look at my case and ask for advice or an estimate on how much it would be to take them to court and I have had no returned calls and the two lawyers that I spoke to said they are not taking any more fraudulent cases. Someone from USAA contacted me after I left a bad review on their website but I have not heard back from them. Instead they updated my current address since I have moved and now the collection agency is sending me the statements to my current address so that alone tells me they have no intention on fixing this or giving me my money back. They also cut off online access to my account so I can't see the activity on my accounts. And as far as USAA contacting me, unless they are telling me that they are going to put all the money back in my account and take me off the collections list then I have nothing more to say to them, and I will continue writing reviews to anyone who will listen to me since that is all I have left to do.",1790

Your monthly charges are not paid off so you owe more interest each month. My husband has been with USAA for 16 years. I used them during the 80's and 90's and started again about 8 years ago. Back in the 1980's they were a fantastic company but they are going downhill fast. I was on the phone with them for over 30 minutes before I even got them to allow me to pay off my charges for this last month so interest would stop accruing. Before that they were telling me that I would have to pay off the entire balance including the balance transfer amount if I wanted to stop the interest from accruing each month.",1795

My insured driver was making a left turn which the pavement is marked with a left arrow only on to a single lane road. My insured driver made the turn following the flow of cars and as he was turning into a business on same road, the truck that should have made a right turn off the freeway exit decided at the last minute, in reviewing the video myself, pulled forward into intersection and then made a hard left turn (this is all on video).  In doing this, the truck created his own lane and in the video it is showing him trying to hurry and bypass another car that was in the center of the single lane road and he reamed right into my insured driver's car.

All the drivers on the policy were the same, all the vehicles were the same, and there were no accidents, claims, or traffic violations. They said sometimes the insurance just goes up and that even the actuaries can't tell you why? Really!

The overdraft wasn't my fault in the first place and in the second place was only for a few dollars! So with no warning they withheld most of my money which screwed up my bill payments and buying necessities for the month! Then they told me that after 30 days the hold would be removed. But it wasn't removed and same thing happened in Oct. Bills screwed up again and not enough money for what I needed to buy! So I called customer service again and they said sometimes they hold money and sometimes not, depends on various factors but didn't know why they were holding mine!  This holding kept going on for several more months and screwing up my finances 'til I figured out that they weren't holding any if I only deposited $100. So I started recently depositing only about $100 and using cash for other things! Crappy way to run a bank to say the least! Now what's got me really upset and has made me write this complaint and decide to switch to another bank very soon is the fact that I made two purchases recently thru PayPal that paypal put thru and PayPal sent me emails saying the payments went thru and items were shipped. So when I went to buy things several days later it turned out the payments hadn't gone thru yet but I didn't know it. So when they finally went thru even later they over drafted.  I called PayPal to make sure they wouldn't put the charges thru a second time like they do. The rep said she couldn't stop the second try coming up, only the third. But that she would send me a letter to forward to the bank that would tell the bank that the charges were being cancelled but they couldn't cancel in time to stop the computer from putting the charges thru again so to NOT charge me double overdraft fees. I forwarded the letter to USAA Bank but they double charged me anyway, that's $116 overdraft fees on only two charges totalling $17 and change!!!  So today when I called, that disgusting excuse for a customer service rep said they weren't going to refund any of the $116 because the letter from paypal didn't say the right thing.

All documents that were requested for obtaining our mortgage loan, my husband uploaded them on USAA website. Then we were informed by Tiffany ** that our mortgage loan was undergoing the first review. Last week I received a call from Tiffany **. She stated that she had a few more questions for us concerning employment. She started off by asking if I was planning on making the 5 Hour drive from where we moving to in Hickory North Carolina to where I was employed currently in Newbern North Carolina every day once we move. I could tell by the way she was talking to me that she was aggravated. And then proceeded to tell her that no I was not planning on driving five hours and that my husband and I both already have job offers where we will be moving. She asked if we had accepted the job offers and I said no not yet but we could if that's what they were wanting. My husband and I both already knew that we were going to take these jobs but we did not see the need to do so super fast because the job offers were for starting in July. (But job offers are for more than what were we are making now.) She then stated that she could not see an allotment that my husband makes every month from his account to my account at Wells Fargo for our savings. She stated that the statement we provided from Wells Fargo for the month of May did not show the allotment. So I quickly pulled up my Wells Fargo account and told her that the allotment is made at the beginning of each month. I could see the allotment for the month of May in my account the last day of April. The allotment is set a transfer from USAA to Wells Fargo at the beginning of each month. I could see the allotment for the month of May in my account the last day of April. Then the next allotment was showing on June 1. I told her that I could get her those statements ASAP. She then asked for our tax statements. I told her that we had signed a waiver for the Loan processor, Anthony **, to attain our tax statements through the IRS. She said that she did not see them uploaded. I told her we could also get those uploaded ASAP. Now just to leave you a little history about my husband and I. My husband will be retiring out of the Marine Corps in August of this year. I am a registered cardiac sonographer and have been since 2005. We both have good credit. Now by the time I drove the hour home from work all of our mortgage loan process had already been erased from our USAA account. We weren't even given an hour to upload the documents requested by us before they had already done away with us. And we have been in the process with them concerning our mortgage loan for a couple weeks now and now everything was gone. During this process my husband was the optimistic one. I got online and read hundreds of reviews and 99% of them were negative reviews concerning USAA's mortgage loans. After what we experience with USAA, neither my husband nor I would recommend our worst enemy trying to finance a mortgage loan through them. And the customer service we experienced with Tiffany was absolutely horrible. We're not sure who to blame with this experience we've had with USAA. We're not sure if it's the underwriter or if it was Tiffany or if it was a combination of both people. All I can say is people please understand that hundreds of negative reviews are not going to be wrong.",1829

Damage was on the front and back passenger doors. I had 3 lights come on immediately: air bag, tire monitor, and stability. The front passenger window is sticking. I had already told Samuel W of USAA and per his suggestion he would send it to the dealership for diagnostic. I noted all this for the adjuster Brian and his response was the lights are not on now and he did not know anything about Cadillacs and that I spilt a coke down the window?. I paid for the diagnostics to be done myself and the body shop owner said nothing was spilt inside the window when he took the door apart to paint it.  I phoned Mr. W to remind him that the diagnostics was his idea and he said I would have to prove the lights came on?. He was very rude and basically called me a liar. All you need to do is listen to our recorded conversations. When I went to pick up my car, the body shop had call USAA about the check and was told per Mr. W I would have to pay for it myself that the check had been mailed to me on Nov. 5.  Today is the 10th and I have not received any money. I called Mr. Ws manager and was told because I did not use their body shop that I had to take responsibility for the bill. This has been a complete nightmare for me. I was involved in an accident to no fault of my own and now I have paid $90.00 for diagnostics and $1,568.77 for a repair. To top it off my window still is not working properly. It sticks and scrapes going up and down.  I do not know how an insurance company can hire such rude and uneducated people to work for them. I am very disappointed in their service and the people they hire to deal with someone who your client has negligently hit. I will be sure to tell everyone I know of my experience with USAA, the customer service agent, his manager and the adjuster they chose to handle the claim that does not know anything about Cadillacs. I will also be filing a complaint with John Oxendines office, The Insurance Commissioner of Georgia about the handling of this claim, the money I have had to pay, and the treatment I have endured from the employees.

"1831",40968.74,"TRACY","Ooltewah","TN",1,"auto",35.087881,-85.06005,"The date of the accident was 7/22/11, when a construction truck driving in front of me on I-75 S in Chattanooga, TN, had a ladder fly out of the back of their truck, that landed and hit the front L bumper of my car, and caused damage to the front of my vehicle. I called USAA and filed a claim, and they gave me an auto repair shop named Abbra in Chattanooga, TN, to take my car to, for an estimate and repair. I went to Abbra on October 6th (I am not sure about the date), and the repair shop was very nice, but suggested I take it to a Lotus dealer, and get their opinion of loss in value, if a non-Lotus shop does the repairs with aftermarket parts, and not use Lotus certified parts. Considering this would be an entire front end clam shell replacement, I called USAA on 8/8/11, to update them on what their repair shop had suggested, and I asked if they knew of any closer Lotus certified repair shops, other than Atlanta GA, and the claims adjuster said no. I informed the adjuster during that call, that it may take me some time to get my car to Lotus of Atlanta, since the shop was 280 miles round trip from where I live, in Chattanooga, TN. It's actually common for owners of Lotus cars to have to travel some distance for oil changes, repairs, and such, due to many shops are not Lotus certified to work on these cars. I told the adjuster I would call and let them know, as soon as I got it to Atlanta. The dealer is open only Mondays-Fridays 8AM-5PM, and I work those days as well, and will have to get a day off of work, to be able to get my car down to Atlanta. On 10/7/11, I tried dropping my car off in Atlanta at the Lotus dealer, and I called to get my rental, and USAA would not approve a rental, because the representative said I did not get an estimate done at the facility they requested I go to, and until an estimate is done, and my car is in the shop for repairs, no rental would be approved through my rental insurance. The adjuster started questioning my claim, and all claims I ever had with USAA, and started throwing out dates and asking, what was this for, when it would be a claim for towing where I broke down one time 10 years ago, things that had nothing to do with my current situation, and needed a rental.  She kept asking me where I had it fixed before, and how do they know my car had no prior damage. She continued to tell me that before anything can be done on my car, that a special investigation had to be done on my past claims. I hung up, called, and got another adjuster, who was very nice, and explained they needed an estimate, before I could drop my car off. I asked why the car couldn't be left in Atlanta, at the shop here who's going to work on it in the first place, and let their adjuster come here. She said no. All this was due to the first USAA shop they sent me to, do not write an estimate, and the first representative kept yelling at me, that I did not follow the proper procedure, when I actually followed exactly what I was told to do. So, I had to drive all the way back 140 miles one way home to Chattanooga, to have an adjuster come out 2 days later, and write an estimate, just so I could drive another 280 miles round trip, to get a rental, and drop the car off, with another day off of work. The USAA independent adjuster came out, looked at the car, and did not have my kind of car in his book, but did tell me the car would need a new front bumper. I know he knew nothing about my car, because the entire front end is one clam shell. Anyway, he uploaded the report to USAA with a total repair of $549.96, with a deductible of $1,000 collision and my cost, meaning the repair is at my cost. Here is another issue that is wrong. I have watched my claim go from a comprehensive claim, which does have a $1,000 to a collision claim, and that deductible is $300. This entire claim has been in error. As of this day, the claim is listed as collision claim, with me owing $1,000 deductible, when my collision deductible is $300, right off the USAA website. My car finally gets dropped off for repair in Atlanta on Jan. 6th, 2012 ,at Lotus of Atlanta, who uses Performance Collision for repairs. My car went to Mike at Performance Collision on Jan. 9th, 2012, and on Jan. 12th, the repair shop sent in their supplement for repair to USAA for approval, and the total amount of repair was approximately $18,900-$19,000. This is what I expected for this kind of vehicle. The repair shop still had not heard anything, and on Jan. 23rd, USAA had a 3rd party appraiser, Gary ** go out to inspect my car. Another week went by with no contact from USAA or Gary, and I'm still using up rental days on my rental reimbursement waiting on USAA. On Feb. 3rd, USAA sends an inside appraiser Mark ** to look at my car, and on Feb. 6th, I still had nothing from USAA on what was going on. I called USAA on 2/6/12, and could of course not get the adjuster, who at this time is Lance **, and the representative had no information to give me other than the adjusters' appraisals were not back. I had a big issue with this, considering now all of my rental reimbursement of $1,500 has been used up, and I am paying out of pocket now, because USAA has provided poor quality service, and it's been 25 days since the repair shop sent their supplement to USAA, and no response on anything has been received, nor has a single adjuster contacted me from my numerous calls and messages. Any information I have received so far, has been through the repair shop. On 2/8/12, I called USAA's inside adjuster Mark **, and left a message. I called USAA, and left a message for the claims adjuster requesting for an extension on my rental, but I did not receive a call back. The representative said that once the policy is maxed that no extensions are given. I explained that normally, it does not take more than 25 days for an insurance company to write an estimate, or approve or deny a supplement. Mark ** calls me back, to tell me my car is possibly a total loss, and that USAA will be contacting me. Mark has been the one and only person that have been of any assistance in finding out what is going on. I explained to him about the rental, and he knew there had been a significant time delay, and he apologized, but told me to call USAA, and tell them what's going on, and ask for a manager, and he would inform his manager of my extra rental cost, and see what could be done. I called USAA back and explained what has happened all over again to another adjuster, and they could speak to Mark ** to verify the delays in this claim, to get rental reimbursement help. On 2/10/12, I finally got a call from my first adjuster who informed me they will not be paying any extra rental. I took the rental car back on 2/12/12, and I now have no replacement vehicle, plus I'm out an additional $794.77 in rental, due to USAA's significant delays in my claim. On 2/13/12, finally, after numerous phone calls over the past several weeks, I got a call from Wendy ** from the Total Loss Department, to tell me my car is a total loss, and they will cut a check for $26,000-$26,999 (unsure of exact price), and I told her that would not work for me, that my car is one of 3 known in the US for color and make for 2005, and something else would have to be worked out. She said my claim would have to go to their special adjuster team for review, and they needed my okay to release my car. I gave it. On 2/15, I received a call from USAA, again telling me I need to release my car to them. I explained I already did this, so the representative did a 3 way call with the repair shop, and the car was released. On 2/20/12, I receive another call from USAA, stating we have to discuss a problem about me not releasing the car, and to call Stephanie **. I called Stephanie, and of course I was routed to her voice mail. I got a representative that tells me the car is not released. I told her this is the third call, and the third time I have released this car, and the last time was through a 3-way call from the USAA adjuster.  She asked if she could 3 way the repair shop, and get my okay to release the car. So for the 3rd time and the 2nd 3-way call, the car was released again. On 2/23/12, I received a letter in the mail from USAA, Wendy **, stating that since I refused to release the car, all storage fees are my responsibility, and per our conversation on 2/17/12, and the letter is a written confirmation of our conversation. Refused? Are you kidding me? First, I did not talk to anyone from USAA on 2/17/12. So I called USAA again, and had to go through this process for the 4th time, but the representative did not 3 way, just called while I was on the phone. I made it very clear that I did not appreciate USAA's adjuster sending a letter, stating I had a conversation with her on 2/17 and refused to release my car to them, and her letter confirms our conversation, because I never spoke to a single person on 2/17/12, and the car had been released 3 times before that date, with 3 way calls made by USAA. That was flat out lying on my claim. On 2/20/12, I called Mark **, the USAA field appraiser, and asked if he could help me find out what's going on with my claim, that no one will call me back from USAA. I left voice mails for Lance and Stephanie (2/15/12, 2/17/12, 2/20/12), and as of 2/23/12, I still have not received one phone call over my claim. I've received info on what storage fees I will be paying (as stated above), but nothing from any total loss adjuster, other than my very first conversation on 2/13/12, telling me the ACV, and it was being reviewed by a special team. Mark told me the special total loss team completed my car report on Tuesday, 2/14/12, and they were not offering a single dollar over what his CCC appraisal had stated. I explained to Mark that no one has let me know anything. I asked Wendy on 2/13, when first telling me the total loss amount, and I asked for the ACV report, and it was never sent to me. I asked the USAA representative again, just minutes ago for the report, and still never got it. I don't have it from USAA as of today. However, Mark was nice enough to scan one for me on 2-22-12. On the ACV (actual cash value) report, there are many things wrong. Many options are marked off, that I do have. Things are easy to see like leather seats, dual mirrors, console storage, 4 wheel disc brakes, and more. The sales tax is stated 7.38% on the value report, but the sales tax in TN is 9.75%. The other problem is these comparables are 800-2,000 miles away from my home, places like Arizona and Connecticut. How can I inspect these for replacement vehicles? Actually, I called the places that were listed by USAA, and 2 of the 3 cars were not available for sale. This comparable report was also done for December 2011, when my total loss was 2/13/12. Why were comparables not used in the current surrounding markets, such as Atlanta, GA, that are closer to me. Also, the average cost of the 3 comparables used are much higher than what USAA offered me for my car. This is a big problem. On 2/27/12, I called USAA, and asked to speak to the VP of claims. The representative told me I could not be transferred. I asked for an email or extension, and she said it could not be given out, that I would have to go through the adjuster, then the management. I explained that I have done this already several times, and still have not heard a word from any of them. She tried to get a manager on the phone, and was unsuccessful. I hung up the phone, and looked up the CEO's contact email information for USAA, and forwarded my complaint. The CCC actual cash value appraisal, with all the things wrong with it, and my comparables I found right close to where I live. I've heard nothing. On 2/28/12, I called the Tennessee Department of Insurance, and was just forwarded back to USAA Claims, and given their number. I'm back where I started. I did get an email today from the office of the CEO, stating they will forward my information to the appropriate party. Who is that? Hopefully, not back to the Total Loss Department. It's impossible to speak to someone from claims at USAA. Yes you can hit 0 and speak to another adjuster, but they have to read the file, you have to update them on what's going on, and they still have to put you on hold, try to reach your adjuster, and nothing happens, because the adjuster is never available. My claim was on 7/22/11, and my car was finally in the repair shop on 1/6/12. I have heard nothing from USAA, other than one call, to tell me my car was a total loss on 2/13/12. All the information I received to date was through the repair shop, or a few calls to the field appraiser. My total loss adjuster, Stephanie **, will not return calls. The management is impossible to get on the phone, even for the employees of USAA. I'm still making payments to the bank on my total loss car, paying full coverage insurance on a total loss car, and no replacement. Overall, they have given no help, nor communication.",1831

Because it was the labor day weekend, USAA would not authorize a rental car so I agreed to pay for a rental car myself through the weekend. USAA agreed to pay for the rental car beginning 9-7-2010 through the remainder of the repair time.  Benson Honda obtained two rear bumpers bought which were found defective upon their arrival. Therefore both were sent back to the manufacturer. My car was finished in eight days instead of the four days USAA estimated that the work should take. Many attempts were made to reach Mr. **, all telephone calls and messages went unanswered. Now I am paying for a rental car while my car is being repaired. USAA did reimburse me a portion of the rental car but were unwilling to consider extenuating circumstances regarding the two defective bumpers. The economic impact is loss of my automobile for 8 days due to negligence of another insured driver.

She was at fault, and even admitted that she was not paying attention to traffic. When I called USAA they questioned the validity of my claim since their customer had not called to report it. Of course she didn't. Why would she call to tell them that she had been in an accident? USAA informed me that they would have to contact their customer to verify my story. After two weeks with no word from them I called USAA. They said nothing had been done yet since they had not been able to contact the woman who hit me.

I finally asked to speak to a supervisor, he puts me on hold and a few minutes later comes back and tells me his supervisor is busy and he'll have to transfer me back to the bank!! Instead, he hangs up on me!! So I call back, this time infuriated and tell the rep what I just went through with the last guy. So she transfers me back to that department with a different rep.  This lady was helpful, she saw that I requested the credits only hold and was confused why they removed the hold after they finished investigating. Then asks me why they didn't issue a stop payment on the checks. I explained I had no idea and she reversed the charges again that I was charged again! Then a few days after that, they called me to say I needed to open a new account! So I go through the process and they denied me the account because of what happened with the old account!!! After thinking about it, I was happy they denied it and told my husband that I didn't want to be with a bank that would let a check that is obviously not one I wrote and didn't match my signature be cashed against my account and not even call to verify it!! So we opened an account elsewhere and are looking for a different car insurance company as well. Not to mention you can't deposit checks through their mobile app unless so much time has passed. You can't deposit from any ATM (they have no branches in my state or any state near me). I would have to go to a UPS Store and deposit checks only that take up to 11 days to process or mail them in!

They told me if my husband died or I divorced him, I could reapply for membership. A few months later, toward the end of 2011, I got a call saying they were closing my savings accounts and my credit card, and denying me access to their website although I still have my IRA there.

I can tell you its been the worse 2 weeks of our life. Thank GOD both men were ok, the poor gentleman car was totaled on the spot. Afterwards my husband assumed things were fine until the car started acting up. USAA got in touch with us, we gave them our information, got things set up for the rental car, and proceeded with the insurance claim. As the claim went on we had some issues getting the time and date set up for the towing, meaning they could not give me a time and date when the tow driver would show up to come get it.  Later on in the evening close to 8pm my neighbor comes over and proceeds to tell me someone is taking my car. Not really sure what to think I run out and am met with a nice gentleman who proceeds to inform me he is the tow driver coming to take my car to the shop. I was quite ill to say the least, i didn't get a call or anything before they showed up! What if I had to run out! Were they really just going to take my car without a call or even a knock at the door when they showed up, I still had some things in my car to get out and was sick so I needed at least 30 minutes to an hour before they showed so I could get dressed and have help getting things out of my truck. After the ordeal was over, and I got my stuff out of the truck (I am not saying it was the tow drivers fault, I imagine if my neighbor wouldn't have told us, he would have came up and let us know why he was there. At least I hope.) He took my truck to the shop where it has sat for nearly two weeks. The rental place they had called in my area was completely out of cars and had no idea when they would get more from one day to the next, so we had to sit home for 4 days until they had one available. Afterwards calling the body shop I got word that they have gathered the estimate and have submitted it to be reviewed. The repair cost was only $1800, at this point it's safe to say I would rather them repaired it than the final outcome. Today December 17, 2014 we were informed that they wanted to settle the case at $2k for the truck. I'm sorry but before the collision that truck was worth more than that, similar SUV's with the same miles and condition sold for over 3k. So far we have objected to the amount, my husband has lost time off work for the last 2 weeks, they were suppose to send us paper work on his injuries so the medical expenses could be covered but I don't even think they have sent that. So far all and all, after reading the reviews here and dealing with them personally, I'm not sure who to feel worse for.

Consistently, USAA Federal Savings Bank claims a 'system glitch' to block or 'freeze' consumer liquid assets. This consistent INTERNAL 'glitch' not only reported by us, by seen in the reviews of others on this site lead us to determine that is a deliberate act by USAA Federal Savings Bank to tie up consumers liquid assets to USAA's benefit. The fact that USAA Bank consistently tells the consumer that the problem is with the consumer's acts when in actuality, it is USAA Bank that has consistently and habitually had the 'system glitch'. I believe that USAA Bank does this to maintain the liquid assets of its consumers for its own benefit. An executive higher up thought this was a good way to increase USAA Bank assets by holding moneys inappropriately and unethical in limbo as to prevent consumers access. Not only are payments delayed in posting, but transfers are 'hung up' in limbo as well.  This many and consistent delays, which are inconsistent with similar institutions in the same business, is indicative of deliberate manipulation of the system. This manipulation is to the benefit of the executives of USAA Bank and to the detriment of the consumers of USAA Bank, our active and retired military personnel and their families. If you have experienced the same 'system glitches' with USAA Bank, please go to the Federal Reserve website and file a complaint as we did.

I called a tow truck out to have my car towed to Rick Hendrick BMW in Charleston, SC. I paid for the towing expense, of course, because I thought I would be reimbursed. (I assumed this was a warranty issue in which my warranty covers rental and towing.) I have USAA auto insurance and their Extended Vehicle Protection Plan so I should be covered for just about anything. After diagnosing my car the service center said that it was a problem with my gas. (The tank was full so I didn't doubt it.) They drained my tank and found some foreign matter in the sample of gas. They immediately told me that it was an insurance problem in which it was pretty obvious that it was and they proceeded to fix the car. My adjuster had to come out to get a sample of the gas to have it tested.  The tests came back negative for any contaminants. How did the test come back negative with obvious foreign substance in the sample? We have no clue. The service center said what the problem was but the adjustor disagreed which I don't think is fair. This is a certified BMW shop. I'm pretty sure they know their cars inside and out. While talking with at least 10 people from USAA insurance they said that my claim had been denied because it was no doubt a warranty problem and kept sending me to the warranty dept. They kept saying the parts failed by themselves so that's why it's a warranty problem. (Keep in mind every part that the gas touched had malfunctioned. Warranty said the fact that every single part, which was about 5 different parts, the gas touched had failed obviously made this an insurance claim. On top of the fact that the service center found the exact problem.)  For about a month and a half I was going back and forth with insurance and warranty trying to figure out who was going to pay for this. I had spent over $500 on a rental for three weeks because insurance told me that my warranty, considering rental is covered with warranty. My superiors wanted to get involved because they know that I was being treated unfairly and it was also affecting me getting to work. All fingers were pointing at insurance but they were throwing their hands up not wanting to pay for anything! In the middle of February I finally got my car back.

The vehicle that hit me was an old Suburban towing a 2 horse trailer (empty) and was driven by a 16 year old girl. Her father had a whole $15,000 liability insurance through GEICO who paid off right away but ER bills and Dr's visits ate that up in a week or two. I had my head turned to the right to block my German Shepherd from climbing over the console and my jaw was jammed tight against my right shoulder bone. When I was hit my jaw was torn at the joints and for two years plus I've fought my OWN Insurance company to pay my medical bills and provide for the $30,000 surgery I need to rebuild my jaw joints. USAA tried to say my jaw injury was a pre-existing condition but my personal dentist refuted that emphatically because he had examined me just prior to the accident.  I was finally paid about half of the ""Med Pay"" part of my policy but only about $2,500 of the $5,000 owed to me. The original adjuster changed positions at USAA and didn't bother to assign my claim to another adjuster until forced to do so. USAA lied about everything from the first contact and treated me like a criminal and finally offered $52,000 to settle. My policy limit was, I thought, $100,000 but after jerking me around they admitted since I took out the policy in New Mexico and had another vehicle insured with them for the same limits, the policy was ""Stacked"" or double, equaling $200,000.  For the next two years I sought out every competent oral surgeon in the Phx area with options to have the surgery (who has $30 grand laying around?) or living with the constant pain of my jaw floating around in various positions. USAA's twerp Scott ** denied that I could have suffered such injuries from a ten mile an hour impact. I'd be perfectly happy to demonstrate on Scott's jaw what sort of damage such an impact could produce. Their latest response, over two years later, is around $58,000 which they seem to think is a lot of money. There was another development in Nov 2016 when I finally took opioids (**) after refusing them for years due to my experiences with drug addicts in my work. I was prescribed 2/day but only took 1/2 because I was very sensitive to such drugs. One Saturday I took two whole ** and the following morning, due to increase pain I took one more. After a short period of time I was in my backyard with my dog and started feeling dizzy and disoriented so I started back to the house, tripped, and broke three ribs, my nose and suffered a subdural hematoma with a skull fracture and bleeding in my brain. I'd never taken half that amount of prescription pain medication in my life and it simply overpowered me. I know people with chronic pain who take 6 or more per day but that's not me... Today I was informed that USAA is going to hire some prostitute specialist in Pennsylvania to refute my 6 doctors and physical therapist. They also have a ""Bio-mechanical"" expert who will refute the claim that I suffered such an injury at such low speed. If you use the formula for foot pounds of force F=Velocity times Mass, you get a staggering figure... But it's a given that an ""Expert Witness"" will parrot anything he's instructed to by the people who hire him. I've seen this many times in my career as a homicide detective and SWAT EOD member. I'm going to have my attorney advise USAA that I'm not giving up and I'll see this all the way to a conclusion more in line with the damage done to me. Binding arbitration is the next step. USAA has a horrible record of denying claims for no good reason. I'd like to look at Scott **'s work records to see just how many times he's been rewarded for claim denials in cases such as mine.

I felt embodied what an insurance company should be like, to then have my homeowner's insurance terminated, not because I didn't pay my bill faithfully, not because I have had excessive claims, not because I failed to meet the enrollment requirement but because this combat Veteran of the Vietnam War lives in a manufactured home - a fact I made no attempt to conceal at any time. The policy on this home has been in force for 14 years. I guess the termination date, December 7th 2012, Pearl Harbor Day's 70th Anniversary, to the day, is just an exclamation point to the treachery we feel we are being subjected to in my household. The manufactured home is, in every respect, better than most stick-built homes and impeccably maintained. It sits on a pad and foundation on 6 acres. Though we are not on a public water system, there is a hydrant one block from the corner of our property line. The shop is detached by 500 and has been inspected and approved by the EPA for compliance under home-based business guidelines. I am writing this, not in anger, but more in bewilderment. I always thought of USAA as a kind of comrade that I could count on like a buddy at my back, a member of our family. I enrolled under the advice of my father who was a two-war veteran and a lifetime USAA member. All of my 10 brothers and sisters are insured through USAA including my brother-in-law, who retired as the last Commander at Fort Vancouver and served as Mayor for that city for 12 years. He was a Silver Star recipient and combat veteran in Vietnam and hosted the Vancouver Medal of Honor Reunion. The thing that made the USAA family different is that we had a bond of allegiance based upon Gen. Robles' own words that simply stated said, ""We are doing the right thing because it is the right thing to do."" The question in my mind is, given the import of this notification, is that still true? The agent who looked into this when I contacted them explained that USAA was in the process of getting rid of all manufactured home policies. They, of course, recommended another insurer which they have a financial interest in promoting. Their premiums are outrageous.

My wife and I had home and auto insurance with USAA for 34 years (we first purchased the insurance when I was in the Marine Corps). Eighteen months ago, we suffered our first liability loss when the water heater in our residential condo burst and caused water damage to the two units below us. Total damage was about $13,500. USAA never disputed that our homeowners' policy covered the water damage, but the adjusters kept looking for every excuse not to pay the claim. This forced my wife and me to pay for the repairs ourselves. It was only after my wife and I threatened to sue USAA did USAA's lawyers confirm that their adjusters were 100% wrong and my wife and I were 100% right. We were ultimately reimbursed by USAA, but it took a full year! Also, during the first Iraq war in 1990-91, my Marine Corps reserve unit was activated. I had an existing life insurance policy with USAA for $100,000 and I asked the company if I could increase the limits to $200,000 to better protect my wife. USAA said no, that they were issuing no new life policies and freezing all existing life policies because of the pending war. What a great company. USAA promotes itself as the insurance company of military members, but it's a total lie. They don't give a damn about military members, just their bottom line. Fortunately, I was able to purchase a $200,000 life policy with Armed Forces Benefit Association just before I was deployed overseas. They had no problems issuing the policy.

"1905",42440.84,"WOLF","Breckenridge","CO",1,"banking",39.5033325,-106.038441,"Back in 2007, we wanted to do a remodel and addition on our house. We asked USAA if we could refinance to get money for the project. They said yes and sent us the requested money and we began the project. 1/3 way through the project, we had an opportunity to do an additional expansion which involved more framing, for $30k more in labor and materials, and it would add significant value to the property. The workmen needed to know within a few days, as they had down time until their next project started and could knock it all out in a week to 10 days. I asked USAA for the $30k. After a 2-hour qualifying phone call, where they 100% knew we were still mid-construction with the original loan amount from them, they approved the additional money. They said that we easily qualified. Our credit was good, the home value was fine, etc. No problems they said. During the 2-hour qualification, USAA said the interest rate would be X on it, which was higher than the interest rate on the original amount. I asked why it was more, and they said they could give me a lower interest rate and all they had to do was an appraisal. I said: ""Sure, you know we have construction going on and the house is down to studs in 70% of it?"" ""Yes, no problem. We will order the appraisal and send the paperwork."" I told the workmen to do the extra work, as I was told I was approved for the money. Well, the ongoing construction was a problem. After the appraisal came back they refused to give the promised money because there was no CO (Certificate of Occupancy) on the home because we were doing the remodel, even though that was CLEARLY explained before they approved the additional money. So, they lied about giving us the money. Would not even give it at the previously mentioned higher rate that did not need an appraisal. No money at all, after I had the extra work done and owed the workmen. That promise of the additional funds was lie #1. I could afford to pay the workmen, as we were still in the framing stage of the project and I had the rest of the funds that were for the finishing work; but to pay them it meant taking money from things like flooring and kitchen cabinets, appliances, bathroom fixtures, etc., and not finishing the project to get the CO. So, after pleading for help with managers at USAA, they offered a credit card, with a small limit (in relation to the funds needed to finish the project) of $10k, and they told me to put the rest on my personal credit cards and when the CO came in, they would refi the house and pay off all the credit cards. Ahh, light at the end of the tunnel. Thanks! So the CO (Certificate of Occupancy) came in 2-3 months later when we wrapped up the finishing details, and I went to refi with USAA, and guess what, the USAA loan to value ratio formula had changed, and we did not have enough equity in our house to qualify for a refi under the new guidelines, plus ""even if we could help you, your credit scores dropped with the high balance on your credit cards."" (Duh! You told us to use our credit cards to finish the house!) So they denied the refi. That promise of a refi after we got the CO was lie #2 and eventually forced us into bankruptcy a couple years later as we could not keep up with $900 month+ credit card payments on $30k worth of charges for JUST the construction portion, with all of our other bills. I sent a certified letter to then-CEO General Robles, asking for some help prior to filing bankruptcy, but got no reply other than they had received the letter and there was nothing they could do. Good ole USAA! So then after not paying on the USAA second mortgage for years since it was discharged in the bankruptcy and had a $0 balance, and after finally recovering from the bankruptcy by improving our credit, we went to refinance with another lender and wanted to remove the lien USAA still has on the property. Of course they wanted their money and even though the bankruptcy showed a $0 balance, they would not remove the lien unless there was a full payment. So I tried to negotiate with them on a settlement. I was told they would accept 75% of the balance. So I went to talk to mortgage brokers to see if we could get the 75% they were demanding. While pursuing this avenue, they sent a demand letter from an attorney within 30 days of our last discussion, without warning, saying the foreclosure department now had the case. Wait, what? We were negotiating and I was checking on getting the funds. When I relayed this, they ""halted"" the foreclosure, but still added legal fees to the total balance. Thanks USAA! Ultimately the 2 options with USAA were: settle for 75% of the full amount as a 1 time payment, or pay the back balance and resume payments with the full amount still owed. Upon me asking questions on what the 2 options would mean as far as our credit, amongst some other questions, I got no answers for several weeks, even with follow up emails and calls. The only reply I got was stating that ""We are working on the answers to your questions."" Finally, on the phone, Kevin **, Rick ** and Stephanie ** stated that if we settle for the 75% it WILL be reported to the credit agencies as a settlement and we had to check out what the ramifications were on that. We were also told that if we resume payments, nothing further will be reported. We researched and learned what a ""settlement"" (i.e. ""short sale"") on a credit report means, and it is almost as bad as a bankruptcy, and would put us in a position of only qualifying for FHA mortgages with higher interest rates and PMI requirements - even after 20% equity - for another 5 years from the date of the settlement... IF we could even qualify. Meanwhile the deadline was approaching and we need to decide if we will settle for 75% with the credit hit or resume payments. Given the settlement is almost as bad as a bankruptcy, we did not want to hit our credit that hard and we withdrew from the refi with the new lender. I ask again, and again, and again, for the questions that STILL were not answered to be answered, other than the comment from Kevin **, Rick **and Stephanie ** about reporting the settlement. Finally, 10 days before the deadline to settle or startup payments again, and 2 months after we were told a settlement would be reported to credit agencies, we get a letter from Rick ** with answers to my questions (kind of), including the credit reporting question. I had to ask for clarification because some of the answers were non-committal or ambivalent or just wrong, like the credit reporting answer was based upon historical reporting, not future reporting like I asked. So upon clarification, David **, Office of the President, answered and said on the credit reporting question that in either case USAA will not report anything different (than the previous discharge) to the credit agencies. Thank you?? Maybe? David ** even told me on a follow-up phone call he thought the timeframe to answer the questions originally was absurd or unreasonable or something to that effect. I reminded him he was CC'd on every email communication I made inquiring about the answers to those questions, and he did not jump in at any time. He had no reply of substance to that clarification. So the original information given to us by Kevin **, Rick ** and Stephanie ** that they would report the settlement to credit agencies influenced our decision and we decided to not refinance, but rather decided to resume payments. Had we been told originally that they would not have reported the settlement, which would therefore not have impacted our credit, we probably would have settled instead of resumed payment and saved 25% on the balance. But by the time we were told they would not report it, it was too late to execute a refinance (1 week until the deadline). This was lie #3 from USAA, either by Kevin **, Rick ** and Stephanie **, or by David **. David ** told me on the phone after this clarification on credit reporting he was ""sorry you received incorrect information regarding the credit reporting."" Once again, we were lied to, and they were ""sorry."" It was absurd that it took them 3+ months to answer some simple questions of what the ramifications of each situation would mean. Like, ""if we resume payments, can we repay on usaa.com"", ""do our USAA member benefits get reinstated"", really hard questions like that that took 3+ months to answer, right until 10 days to the deadline, and then the answers as it pertained to credit reporting flip-flopped, which would have changed our decision. Bottom line, in my opinion: USAA is a company NOT to be trusted! I feel they have no honesty, honor, or dignity. They will say what they want, when they want, without any responsibility for promises made. They will break promises and/or lie repeatedly. They will drag their feet when crucial information is needed to make educated decisions. It is a sad state of affairs when they will easily lie, and ruin lives by those lies, without a second thought or an ounce of remorse. They put us into a situation to cause our bankruptcy and could care less about that.",1905

USAA claims to support the military family, but in actuality they are assisting in killing mine. I'm a hundred percent disabled veteran with two children. USAA has failed to take responsibility of their preferred contractor. USAA has a contract with contractor connections, and together they claim that they guarantee the work of their preferred contractors for 3 years. Which is not the case at all. I have taken this matter all the way to the office of the CEO of USAA, and they refused to assist in this matter. I paid my premium on time every month for the last 20 years. Now they refuse to assist me. On December 7, 2015 No Limits Construction was paid by USAA for the following service.They were hired to replace all of the drywall after water backup in my home. Mold removal from the water was done by Service Masters, and Eco Systems Industrial Hygienist was hired to ensure that there was no more mold growth, and the house was cleared of environmental hazards and mold prior to No Limits Construction started there work. No Limits Construction was paid a total of $11, 834. 40 for their work. They were hired by USAA as a Premier Contractor. On July 20, 2016, I noticed that there was mold growing in the sump area, and I informed USAA of the problem.  On August 4, 2016 a representative from USAA came to my house about the mold growing, after my house had been repaired about 4 months ago. They determined that the door that was placed on the sump pump area when the house was repaired caused no ventilation in that area, and caused mold to grow rapidly in that area. This is not due to my fault, it is due to the contractor placing a door in that area, where there was previously none. Now this must be fixed. I am a 100 percent disabled veteran with severe health problems. It has been over a week and I have not had any communications about this problem, and plans on who is going to fix this problem. In the meantime mold is rapidly growing and this interferes with my health. It is unsafe for me to stay in my home with mold growing. I am requesting to be placed in a hotel until this problem is taken care of, as soon as possible. That space has been opened every since I bought this home in 2002, so air could flow from the sump area, therefore condensation could not build up, and no mold issue would occur. But When No Limits Construction did not follow proper procedures and closed up the sump area, condensation built up, and mold begin to grow in the work area. They were suppose to leave my property in the same condition prior to the water damage. So by not following the scope of work they caused more damage to my home, by blocking air circulation and black mold started growing. On August 11, 2016 I was informed by USAA that No Limits Construction agreed to remove the barrier, and also to remove the mold. To this date, I still have the barrier and Black Mold still growing in my home.  No Limits Construction came to my home and set up professional size humidifiers in the sump area, and also placed black plastic over the closest doors leading to the sump area, and stated that they would be back to finish mold removal. But instead a week later they returned with an Industrial Hygienist which they hired and personal associate. No Limits Construction hired a Environmental Hygienist to state that the mold was not caused by the enclosure they installed. Which was insulting, because they were trying to take advantage of a 100 Percent Disabled Female Veteran, by causing serious health conditions and financial hardship for a reckless error that they caused.  USAA stated that they would pay for a second opinion for the cause of the mold. Eco Systems. Eco Systems determined that the cause of the Mold was due to the enclosure that No Limits Construction installed, caused no ventilation and condensation and Mold to grow. Eco Systems informed USAA via phone On October 3, 2016 of their professional findings. Therefore that is two inspectors that stated the mold was caused by their improper installation.  From October 3, 2016 until October 20, 2016, I constantly sent emails to USAA emails concerning the mold growth, and my emails were ignored. I called No Limits Construction and they also ignored my phone calls. I am a 100 Percent Disabled Veteran, and I fight on the behalf of Veterans for them to get the benefits they they deserve. I currently have nearly a half of million veterans that I support on a daily basis. I enlisted their support in getting USAA to respond to this environmental hazard caused by No Limits Construction LLC. Only after hundreds of emails from concerned veterans made complaints to USAA about the unprofessional treatment and service I was receiving did I finally get a response. On October 27, I emailed USAA and asked again for the report from Eco Systems to determine the cause of the mold. Months have passed and I still haven't received the report from Eco Systems yet, USAA disapproved the claim and stated that it was a matter between me and Eco Systems. They were in receipt of the report since October 27, 2016, and still failed to use the report in rendering a decision in the causation of the mold.  It is clear to see by the Environmental Report by EcoSystems and the Claims Agent that inspected my home sent by USAA that the cause of the mold is caused by No Limits Construction. They stated they would take care of the situation, then backed out of it. USAA stated that they were responsible for lodging while mold removal and laboratory testing from the industrial hygienist came back. They were not willing to pay for appropriate lodging for my family. I am a 100 Percent Disabled Veteran, and I can not afford to pay for hotel lodging.  No Limit Construction is aware of this, and knew that, would prevent them from removing the mold. They would have caused me and my family to be homeless while mold was removed. This is despicable unprofessional, and I pray that the board can rectify this complaint.

But when I try to pay a bill it takes anywhere from 7-20 days for it to process. I tried to pay my insurance and they NEVER pull the money so I always think I have extra money, and then they are complaining about the money. I'm switching to a new insurance. On 19 Nov. '15 I proposed to the love of my life (it was a ""yes""). I bought her a ring from a grant I got for school. I went to pay the December payment and they told me today that it was insufficient funds because they never pulled their money. Now I'm screwed. Thanks USAA.",1916

I recently had a loss of one of the items, a milling machine which I purchased for 10,000$. The person I bought this piece of equipment had previously agreed to hold the item for me and then claimed because I had not picked up the item in an appropriate time after full payment was made, said she would be reselling the mill and left the state. I had a policy on this mill to its full value. After the police could not locate the seller, and my attempts at litigation failed due to the fact that the seller had disappeared, USAA stated that the policy they had issued for that item was not valid and initially claimed they would move it over to my renters policy and cover it that way. 60 days later I was told that they were denying my claim completely. This has caused a loss of 10,000$ and loss of time with their delay in processing the claim which could have been used to attempt further litigation. The insurance policy had been in place for many months, and USAA had reviewed my policies numerous times and I had been informed more than once that the high dollar item policies were acceptable. My yearly premium for home, renters, auto, and high dollar items was 4800$ a year and USAA has refused to process this claim in a timely manner, claimed that they policies they issued were invalid, and failed to properly process this claim.",1920

He gave me a list of things that I needed to get for him, including a bill from one of her doctors. He gave me until 7pm, May 26th, Arizona time to get this information to him. At 4:40pm, Chicago time, I called him with all the information he requested. He told me I had missed the deadline. I asked him how could this be when I had spoken to him several times today, and he had created an urgency for me to get this info to him by 5pm Arizona time. He said sorry, you missed the deadline. USAA, Justin specifically, strung me along to get information for him that he needed in order to process the claim properly. He just wanted the claim to expire. He is unethical and should lose his license.",1921
